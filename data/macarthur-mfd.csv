	About A.E.'s Work

	A. E. Stallings is a poet and translator mining the classical world and traditional poetic techniques to craft works that evoke startling insights about contemporary life. In both her original poetry and translations, Stallings exhibits a mastery of highly structured forms (such as sonnets, couplets, quatrains, and sapphics) and consummate skill in creating new combinations of meter, rhyme, and syntax into distinctive, emotionally compelling verse. Trained in classical Latin and Greek and currently living in Athens, she brings a wide knowledge of Greco-Roman literature, art, and mythology to bear on her imaginative explorations of contemporary circumstances and concerns. In Hapax (2006), Stallings imbues figures and events from classical drama and mythology with a modern sensibility. ""First Love,"" written as a multiple-choice quiz, intertwines the Persephone myth with a chilling account of infatuation, and ""XII Klassikal Lymnaeryx"" emphasizes the satiric edge to Greek myth through a series of limericks in witty, unexpected diction. For her ambitious translation of De Rerum Natura (The Nature of Things, 2007), Stallings rendered Lucretius's epic-length treatise on the nature of reality into rhyming fourteeners. The unusual meter and colloquial language she employs capture every cadence of Lucretius's enthusiasm for his subject while also making the complexities of his argument easily understandable. Through her technical dexterity and graceful fusion of content and form, Stallings is revealing the timelessness of poetic expression and antiquity's relevance for today.

	A. E. Stallings received an A.B. (1990) from the University of Georgia and an M.St. (1992) from the University of Oxford.

	About Aaron's Work

	Aaron Dworkin is a talented violinist, charismatic arts educator, and the Founder and President of the Detroit-based Sphinx Organization. He and his organization have expanded access for increased numbers of minorities to careers in classical music around the country. Through his efforts, he has transformed the lives of many African-American and Latino musicians and changed the landscape of classical music in America. As minorities currently comprise only 1.5 percent of professional symphony players in the United States, Sphinx set a course to attract young men and women to classical music, countering their perception that such careers face insurmountable barriers and providing them with rigorous training, affordable instruments, and performance opportunities. The results have been to turn out fresh new talent second to none and to fill a void recognized by all. Determined to reverse the isolation of whole populations of young musicians from the beauty, value, and meaning of classical music, Dworkin began by organizing an annual national competition for minority string players. His programs grew rapidly to encompass an orchestra entirely composed of African-American and Latino musicians; a summer training program for underprivileged string players; music education outreach programs in Detroit public schools; an instrument fund for players unable to afford them; and a scholarship fund for deserving musicians who otherwise could not go on for advanced training. Through his programs and nurturing support, Dworkin assures access and enriches symphonies across the country.

	About Adam's Work

	Adam Riess is a young astronomer whose observations are taking us to the edge of the universe, telling the story both of its beginning and its end. As a postdoctoral fellow, Riess served as first author of one of the seminal papers of 20th-century astronomy. He and his colleagues, along with a simultaneous report from a competing group, showed not only that the universe is expanding, as Hubble demonstrated decades ago, but also that the rate of expansion is actually accelerating. They accomplished this by measuring in the most distant regions of space the spectral properties of rare but well-characterized supernovas known as Type Ia. By comparing the brightness of the event (which indicates distance) with the redshift (which indicates velocity), they found a non-linear relationship — relative motion of more distant objects changes disproportionately with their distance. Since then, Riess has led rigorous efforts to use the Hubble Space Telescope to increase the precision of the data, thereby reducing the plausibility of alternative explanations of the original result. This finding has profound implications for cosmology, helping us to better understand the “shape” of the universe, as well as other areas of theoretical physics. In cosmology, it is understood that the observable mass in the universe cannot account for the measured rate of expansion. Theoreticians have postulated the existence of “dark matter” (mass that our current instruments cannot detect), but estimates suggest that even that is insufficient; some believe that massless “dark energy” represents the main driving force for cosmic acceleration. Riess is now actively engaged in designing experiments and devices to detect and measure dark energy.

	About Adrian's Work

	Adrian Nicole LeBlanc is a nonfiction writer who writes like a novelist in the very best tradition of literary journalism. A prolific author of magazine and newspaper articles, many on the effects of poverty on adolescents, LeBlanc redefined immersion reporting in her first book, Random Family: Love, Drugs, Trouble and Coming of Age in the Bronx (2003). The result of a decade spent closely involved in the lives of her subjects, this ten-year odyssey stretches the very fabric of long-form nonfiction and demonstrates LeBlanc’s mastery as observer of human character. Her haunting study enables readers to inhabit the daily chaos and brutal violence of a community in an impoverished Bronx neighborhood, revealing its inner workings and creating an intimate chronicle of urban poverty. It is an original, surprising, and unsettling work of nonfiction that helps readers see and value the humanity in even the poorest lives and to find meaning, as do LeBlanc’s subjects, in the most ordinary moments. Her current project, an investigation of the world of stand-up comedians, also explores lives at the margin and delves into the distinctive realities of the comic underworld and the characters that inhabit it. With an eye for detail and a passion for depth, Adrian LeBlanc is forging a new form of literary reportage and illuminating worlds little known and less understood.

	About Ahilan's Work

	Ahilan Arulanantham is an attorney working to secure the right to due process for individuals facing deportation. Through advocacy and successful litigation of a series of landmark cases, Arulanantham has expanded immigrant detainees’ access to legal representation and limited the government’s power to detain them indefinitely. Courts have traditionally characterized deportation proceedings as civil cases, which means defendants do not have many of the rights guaranteed to criminal defendants, including the right to counsel and the right to ask for release on bond. As a result, immigrants going through deportation hearings often have to represent themselves in complex proceedings, during which they can be detained for months or even years.

	Arulanantham worked with a group of human rights attorneys to challenge indefinite detentions in Nadarajah v Gonzales (2006) and the class action suit Rodriguez v Robbins. The 2013 Rodriguez ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit established that immigrants in pending removal proceedings have the right to ask for bond at a hearing if they have been detained for six months or longer. Hundreds of people in immigration proceedings, including asylum seekers and parents and spouses of U.S. citizens, were immediately given an opportunity to seek release to their families while waiting for their cases to be adjudicated. In 2016, the Supreme Court will consider whether to reverse the Rodriguez ruling or instead extend the right to ask for release on bond nationwide. For the class action suit Franco-Gonzalez v Holder, launched in 2010, Arulanantham led a coalition of attorneys and other advocates to secure the right to appointed counsel for immigrants with mental disabilities. The named plaintiff in the Franco-Gonzalez case had been languishing in detention for nearly five years without a bond hearing or an attorney. The 2013 ruling in the case was the first to entitle an entire class of non-citizens to legal representation.

	Arulanantham is currently advocating for extending the right to counsel to another vulnerable population—children placed in deportation proceedings—in J.E.F.M. v Lynch. Through his incremental approach and careful selection of cases, Arulanantham works to demonstrate the human costs of denying due process to immigrants and to set vital precedents to expand the rights of non-citizens.

	About Ai-jen's Work

	Ai-jen Poo is a labor organizer whose compelling vision of the value of home-based care work is transforming the landscape of working conditions and labor standards for domestic or private-household workers. The estimated 1–2 million domestic workers—housekeepers, nannies, caregivers for the elderly or disabled—in the United States today are excluded from most federal and state labor laws, including collective bargaining; occupational safety and health protections; sick and vacation pay; and protection from discrimination and sexual harassment.

	Combining a deep understanding of the complex tangle of human relations around domestic work with keen strategic skills, Poo has created a vibrant, worker-led labor movement and spearheaded successful legislative campaigns at the national and international levels. As lead organizer of the New York City–based Domestic Workers United (2000–2009), she spent countless hours in parks, buses, and other gathering places for domestic workers, creating opportunities for these largely isolated women to share their experiences, guiding mistreated workers to appropriate legal channels, articulating the vital economic role of domestic workers, and developing with workers a framework of legal standards for the industry. In 2010, New York enacted the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights—which entitles workers to overtime pay, one day of rest per week, protection from discrimination, and three days paid leave per year—after a hard-fought seven-year legislative campaign led by Poo and a dedicated group of workers and advocates. The bill also drew support from an unlikely coalition of domestic workers, their employers, and other unions forged by Poo’s ability to leverage common interests across diverse groups.

	Several other states have passed or are currently considering similar legislation supported by the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and through mobilization of thousands of workers to tell their stories during the open comment period, Poo was instrumental in the Department of Labor’s recent decision to include caregivers for the elderly and disabled in federal minimum wage and overtime protections. Currently, she is developing the Caring Across Generations campaign, which unites (many immigrant) home care workers and elders needing long-term care around their confluence of interests, building support for immigration, health care, and labor policies that will both create good jobs and provide quality care for the aged. As the American workforce is increasingly defined by intermittent, service-based, and part-time work and the need for care workers explodes as baby boomers age, Poo is catalyzing a movement of respect and improved working conditions for millions of workers.

	Ai-jen Poo received a B.A. (1996) from Columbia University and began her work in organizing in 1996 with the Women Workers Project at the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence.

	About Aleksandar's Work

	Aleksandar Hemon is an author whose fiction grapples with the traumas of exile and ethnic conflict. Hemon’s Nowhere Man (2002), a novel-in-stories, follows the circuitous path of a young Bosnian refugee with an appropriately circuitous narrative form; the work’s seven sections shift back and forth between first-person narrators and move freely in setting from Chicago to Sarajevo to Kiev to Shanghai. Through this interspersing of multiple voices, locales, and time periods, Hemon creates an expansive fictional universe, one in which disparate events and memories are salvaged from the sweep of history and presented with humor and compassion. In similar experimental fashion, the stories collected in The Question of Bruno (2000) take such varied forms as a series of undelivered letters and a child’s spy fantasy footnoted with “facts” from The Greatest Spies of World War II. Using his adopted language, English, Hemon dramatizes with wit and dexterity the cultural displacement that he and his characters have endured. His voice invigorates American literature and succeeds in conveying moving stories from the otherwise incommunicable experience of war.

	Aleksandar Hemon received a B.A. (1990) from the University of Sarajevo and an M.A. (1995) from Northwestern University. Born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hemon traveled to the United States in 1992 as a young journalist on a government-sponsored cultural visa. Unable to return due to the violent unrest of the Bosnian War (1992–1995), he settled as a refugee in Chicago. He is the author of two books and numerous works of short fiction that have been published in Esquire, Granta, Ploughshares, and The New Yorker.

	About Alex's Work

	Alex Ross is a critic whose writing captures the often-elusive aesthetic and technical aspects of classical and contemporary music with clarity, grace, and wit. A staff writer for the New Yorker, his frequent essays display an expansive knowledge of music and a facility for guiding his readers, who range from professional musicians to scholars to the general public alike, to a richer experience of the complex pieces and artists he explores. With a finely tuned grasp of a full spectrum of styles, he places works by a broad variety of artists — from Mozart to Schoenberg to Bob Dylan — within a continuum and sets aside categories and classifications that impede the appreciation of works on their own terms. In each article, Ross strives to demonstrate how a specific piece of music, be it centuries or months old, conveys meaning and feeling in the present. In addition to his work in essay form, he recently published the book The Rest Is Noise (2007), a cultural history of 20th-century music that journeys through pre-World War I Vienna, Paris of the 1920s, Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s Russia, and New York of the 1960s and 1970s. Through a widely read blog of the same title (www.therestisnoise.com), he further expands the reach of his interpretive skills and enthusiasm for championing overlooked composers and out-of-the-way ensembles. In an era when many proclaim the imminent demise of concert halls due to waning attendance, Ross offers both highly specialized and casual readers new ways of thinking about the music of the past and its place in our future.

	About Alex's Work

	Alex Truesdell is a visionary social entrepreneur who creates low-tech, affordable tools and furniture that enable children with disabilities to participate actively in their homes, schools, and communities. Truesdell challenges our assumption that disabilities are fixed and instead suggests that limitations can be minimized, or even eliminated, with effective user-inspired adaptations—the kind she creates as founder and director of the nonprofit Adaptive Design Association (ADA).

	Most devices that help children with special needs are expensive and mass-produced and must be replaced as a child ages. Each item built by ADA, in contrast, is the result of extensive collaboration with a child and family in order to optimize how the user will function at home or school. Truesdell’s innovative construction processes use common and affordable materials, such as corrugated cardboard and glue, to allow designers to prototype, build, and fit equipment on-site quickly and inexpensively. The result is unique, imaginative, and thoroughly useful products. Examples include steps (customized with superhero designs) that allow a young boy to climb in and out of his wheelchair without assistance, a seat insert that makes a standard classroom desk accessible for a little person, and a rocking chair that a non-walking child can propel and that can be combined with a detachable tray for eating or play.

	Driven by a determination to help children anywhere, she disseminates adaptive design methods through in-person classes, internships, how-to videos, and forthcoming online workshops. She has reached families, clinicians, and educators across the United States and as far away as India, Guatemala, and Ecuador. Truesdell’s innovative approach to designing and building low-cost, high-quality adaptive equipment is improving the lives of thousands of children and disrupting traditional approaches to assistive technologies.

	About Alexei's Work

	Alexei Kitaev is a physicist who explores the mysterious behavior of quantum systems and their implications for developing practical applications, such as quantum computers. Since his days as an undergraduate, he has made important theoretical contributions to a wide array of topics within condensed matter physics, including quasicrystals and quantum chaos, among others. More recently, Kitaev has devoted considerable attention to the use of quantum physics for performing computation. Upon learning of the first algorithm for factoring numbers (an important aspect of cryptography) with quantum computers, he independently developed an alternative approach using “phase estimation,” a solution that generalizes to an even wider range of calculations. At the quantum level, physical interactions often display bizarre, counterintuitive properties that are generally unobservable at the macroscopic level. Kitaev has shown how, under certain circumstances, macroscopic systems can maintain their quantum coherence, even in the presence of external noise. Though his work is focused mainly at the conceptual level, he also participates in efforts to develop working quantum computers. Through his deep insights into the fundamental nature of quantum physics, Kitaev reveals a rich picture of this unfamiliar world, bringing us closer to the realization of the full potential of quantum computing.

	About Alexei's Work

	Alexei Ratmansky is a choreographer who is revitalizing classical ballet in dynamic, energetic interpretations of traditional works and his own original pieces. Born in St. Petersburg, trained at the Bolshoi Ballet School in Moscow, and currently serving as artist in residence with New York City’s American Ballet Theater, Ratmansky is steeped in the tradition of classical ballet but also inflects the canonical steps of Russia and the West with a technical idiom all his own, one that pushes dancers in new directions through a supple use of the upper body and daring, athletic partnering for both men and women.

	Drawn to seminal, complex scores by Russian composers such as Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and Shostakovich, Ratmansky mines both his expansive knowledge of classical ballet’s history and the rhythms, harmonies, and orchestrations of the music to create powerful story-driven pieces. For stagings of well-known classics such as The Nutcracker and The Firebird, Ratmansky reimagines each character, adding personal qualities and quirks that bring the role to life in a fresh way and reveal nuances and shadings of the piece that infuse it with a modern sensibility.

	Ratmansky’s masterful use of gesture in his Concerto DSCH (2008), set to the music of Shostakovich’s Concerto No. 2 in F Major, Op. 102, creates a self-contained world in which relationships of love, camaraderie, and jealousy are made manifest. He continues his investigation of Shostakovich and reflection on the tormented idealism of artists living in Stalinist Russia in his recent trilogy of dances (2012–2013) choreographed to works from various stages of Shostakovich’s career. As Ratmansky re-envisions the classical repertoire and creates his own striking contemporary works, he is moving the field of ballet in new directions while honoring the accomplishments of the past.

	Alexei Ratmansky studied at the Bolshoi Ballet School (1978–1986) and at the State Institute of Theater Arts (GITIS) (1988–1992). He was artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet (2004–2009) prior to joining the American Ballet Theatre as artist in residence in 2009. He has choreographed works for the Mariinsky Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, New York City Ballet, Royal Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, and American Ballet Theater, among other companies.

	Alisa Weilerstein is a young cellist whose emotionally resonant performances of both traditional and contemporary music have earned her international recognition. As a soloist with some of the world's most prestigious orchestras and conductors, Weilerstein is a consummate performer, combining technical precision with impassioned musicianship. Raised in a family devoted to the arts, she began performing on the cello as a preschooler and made her public debut with a professional orchestra at the age of thirteen. Unlike many musical prodigies, Weilerstein chose to pursue a liberal arts degree while continuing to maintain a busy performance schedule as both a soloist and as a chamber musician, performing and recording with her parents as the Weilerstein Trio. While her repertoire includes the classics, Weilerstein is a tireless advocate for contemporary music, introducing audiences to works by major composers of our day and, in many cases, performing with them. In 2007, she worked with composer Osvaldo Golijov on a complete revision of Azul, his concerto inspired by a Pablo Neruda poem, incorporating orchestra, accordion, and percussion to support cello melodies. Performing in more than one hundred concerts a year, Weilerstein has successfully navigated the transition from child prodigy to accomplished, professional musician and is expanding the cello repertoire through her collaborations with leading contemporary composers.

	About Alison's Work

	Alison Bechdel is a cartoonist and graphic memoirist exploring the complexities of familial relationships in multilayered works that use the interplay of word and image to weave sophisticated narratives. Bechdel’s command of sequential narrative and her aesthetic as a visual artist was established in her long-running comic strip, Dykes to Watch Out For (1983–2008), which realistically captured the lives of women in the lesbian community as they influenced and were influenced by the important cultural and political events of the day.

	Garnering a devoted and diverse following, this pioneering work was a precursor to her book-length graphic memoirs. Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic (2006) is a nuanced depiction of a childhood spent in an artistic family in a small Pennsylvania town and of her relationship with her father, a high school English teacher and funeral home director. An impeccable observer and record keeper, Bechdel incorporates drawings of archival materials, such as diaries, letters, photographs, and news clippings, as well as a variety of literary references in deep reflections into her own past.

	Bechdel composes an intricate, recursive narrative structure that is compelling on both the visual and verbal planes in Are You My Mother? A Comic Drama (2012), a meditation on her relationship with her emotionally distant mother seen through the lens of psychoanalytic theory. As in Fun Home, the images in Are You My Mother? do not always correspond to or illustrate the words; rather, they mutually interpret or often tug against each other, creating a space between them that invites a multiplicity of interpretations. With storytelling that is striking for its conceptual depth and complexity in structure as well as for the deft use of allusion and reference, Bechdel is changing our notions of the contemporary memoir and expanding the expressive potential of the graphic form.

	About Allan's Work 

	Allan Sly is a mathematician and probability theorist resolving long-standing open problems in statistical physics and theoretical computer science. 

	Sly’s accomplishments include important findings pertaining to the threshold for recovering clusters in the sparse stochastic block model; pathbreaking work on cutoff in Markov chains; and the discovery of a key to constructing embeddings of random sequences into random sequences. He has also determined a proof of the satisfiability conjecture for large k, linking a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science to one in statistical physics. To solve these problems that have confounded many strong mathematicians before him, Sly develops novel tools with broad applicability. For example, he has introduced an innovative strategy called “information percolation” to analyze the cutoff phenomenon in Ising-Glauber models (the existence or not of a sharp transition within a short time window from an unmixed state to the mixed equilibrium state), new graphical methods for the proof of the satisfiability conjecture, and a new geometric approach to the slow bond problem.

	Through conceptual breakthroughs in methodology, Sly is making fundamental progress on important and difficult problems that are of central interest to mathematics and have important applications in many other fields.

	About Amy's Work 

	Amy Finkelstein is an economist investigating the ways in which health care policy affects health, health care, and well-being. Using novel empirical designs in tandem with sophisticated econometric techniques and theoretical models, Finkelstein has undertaken large-scale studies to shed light on the unintended consequences—for individuals, companies, and society—of well-intentioned programs that manage and distribute medical and social services, particularly in private health insurance markets, and in public Medicare and Medicaid programs.

	In early seminal work, Finkelstein unearthed tensions between classic theory models and real-world functioning of private health insurance markets. She and collaborators created new frameworks to better understand adverse selection in insurance markets (that is, the likelihood of less healthy people purchasing more insurance than healthy individuals) and to measure the costs to society of adverse selection in the form of insurance coverage and pricing. Another strand of ongoing research has focused on Medicare and Medicaid programs. In a 2007 study, she analyzed the impact of the introduction of Medicare in 1965 on the health care sector as a whole, not just on individuals, and revealed the previously under-acknowledged role of Medicare in the growth of health spending more broadly, among other insights. Recognizing the opportunity presented by the state of Oregon’s 2008 use of random lottery drawings to expand Medicaid coverage, Finkelstein created the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of how covering the uninsured with Medicaid affects their health, health care use, and economic security.  She and co-authors confirm some expected outcomes—such as the financial and psychological benefits of health insurance—but disprove others, in particular showing that increased access to health insurance does not decrease the use of emergency room services. With this work, Finkelstein demonstrated the feasibility and importance of using RCTs for analysis of health policies and programs. She has gone on to use randomized evaluations to study the impact of alternative payment reforms in Medicare and efforts to increase enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

	In this extensive and growing body of rigorous research, Finkelstein is challenging conventional assumptions about the economics of health care and providing stakeholders and health care institutions with data-driven guidance for validating program refinements and designing future interventions.

	About Amy's Work

	Amy Rosenzweig is a chemist whose work is revealing the structural mechanisms for metal metabolism in living cells. Transition metals such as copper, iron, and zinc play critical roles in the catalytic activity of many enzymes, but they can also be toxic if they accumulate out of control. Rosenzweig uses X-ray crystallography to explore the structural basis for the activity of proteins that regulate metal trafficking. Enzymes that use metals as cofactors are often located in the inner compartments of cells; metals are transported to these enzymes by another class of proteins known as “chaperones.” Each chaperone type transports a specific metal ion (e.g., copper) to its target enzyme. In one system, Rosenzweig’s group has shown that one end of the chaperone molecule shares a structural similarity with other copper-binding molecules and a second segment is homologous with the target enzyme, suggesting a geometric basis for the transfer of copper from the chaperone to the enzyme. Although Rosenzweig’s research focuses on bio-inorganic structures at the atomic and molecular scale, the implications for biology are profound. Aberrant metal metabolism has been identified as the critical factor in several diseases (e.g., Menkes syndrome, Wilson disease, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and may represent an important element in others (e.g., Alzheimer’s and prion diseases). Among other recent projects, Rosenzweig and her colleagues have explored the role of magnesium in beta-lactam formation; understanding this reaction will be important for overcoming resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins. Rosenzweig’s research expands our understanding of basic processes at the interface of bio-inorganic chemistry and cell physiology, and these findings are likely to have significant implications for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases.

	An-My Lê is an artist whose photographs of landscapes transformed by war or other forms of military activity blur the boundaries between fact and fiction and are rich with layers of meaning. A refugee from Vietnam and resident of the United States since 1975, much of Lê’s work is inspired by her own experience of war and dislocation. From black and white images of her native Vietnam taken on a return visit in 1994 to pictures of Vietnam War battle re-enactments in rural America, her photographs straddle the documentary and the conceptual, creating a neutral perspective that brings the essential ambiguity of the medium to the fore. In her series 29 Palms (2003–2004), Lê documents American soldiers training in a desert in Southern California before their deployment to Iraq. She focuses her camera alternately on young recruits and the harsh terrain in which they practice their drills, lending an obvious artificiality to the photographs that invites speculation about the romance and myth of contemporary warfare. Currently, Lê is documenting the U.S. military’s presence at sites around the world where personnel are undertaking training missions, patrolling international waterways, and offering humanitarian aid. An additional series in progress explores the ongoing ties between Vietnamese nationals who have migrated to southern Louisiana over the past twenty-five years and their homeland in the Mekong Delta. Approaching the subjects of war and landscape from new and powerful perspectives, this accomplished photographer continues to experiment and contribute profoundly to the evolution of her medium.

	About Ana Maria's Work

	Ana Maria Rey is a theoretical physicist working across the interfaces of atomic, molecular, optical, and condensed matter physics with the goal of using mathematical models to describe the complex behavior of nature. Rey is tackling this challenge through her research on ultracold optical-lattice systems, which will facilitate progress in areas such as quantum simulation and quantum information and enable the preparation of large-scale entanglement between atoms.

	Through her ability and willingness to forge close collaborations across the physics community, Rey’s fundamental conceptual research in optical lattices is being leveraged by experimentalists to simulate, manipulate, and control novel states of matter, including quantum magnets, superfluids, and insulators that are important for understanding quantum phenomena like superconductivity. With colleagues, Rey is developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for an optical-lattice quantum computer based on alkaline earth metals. This effort has already proposed solutions for the key problems of storing, addressing, and transporting qubits (the quantum version of a classical bit in computing).

	She is now working to resolve long-standing impediments to large-scale entanglement between atoms. A quantum computer requires entangled states—which occurs when the quantum states of two or more atoms become linked or connected—for both communication and computation. Rey’s theory offers a novel solution for maintaining coherence (or stability) in a quantum computer using unique properties of alkaline earth atoms, such as their large number of internal degrees of freedom. Rey’s collaborations with experimentalists have also enabled advances in the development of an optical atomic clock and quantum simulations with polar molecules and trapped ions, which in turn have opened up new theoretical explorations of quantum many-body effects and entanglement. Rey has started her independent career in research with significant contributions to condensed matter physics that harken a promising trajectory for novel theoretical approaches to quantum phenomena.

	Anders Winroth, a scholar of legal history, traces the development of medieval canon law, an important intellectual antecedent to contemporary legal reasoning. His research has focused on Gratian’s Decretum, the first scholastic canon law textbook produced in the Middle Ages, and one of the seminal books of European history. The format and vocabulary of the Decretum set the tone for the development of Western law, both religious and secular, from the medieval period to the present. In his monograph, The Making of Gratian’s Decretum, Winroth shows that manuscripts previously thought to be abbreviations of the standard text are actually early versions of the text. This painstaking analysis would have been impossible absent his mastery of canon law, command of medieval Latin, and aptitude for paleographic reconstruction of materials that exist primarily in the form of unedited medieval manuscripts. By reversing the chronology of the earliest publications in canon law, Winroth opens new avenues for interpreting its origins and development. Beyond its obvious implications for understanding the roots of contemporary canon and constitutional law, his work reemphasizes the frequently underestimated importance of the Middle Ages in the intellectual development of Western European civilization.

	About Andrea's Work

	Andrea Dutton is a geochemist and paleoclimatologist reconstructing sea levels and ice sheet changes during earlier periods of global warming on Earth. A robust understanding of the ancient interactions among global temperatures, ice volumes, and sea levels is critical for assessing the magnitude and rate of future sea level rise due to climate change. Dutton has developed a strategy for using the geological record of ancient shorelines to quantify the global sea level of the last interglacial period (approximately 125,000 years ago), when the global climate was similar to present day.

	She undertakes fieldwork around the world to painstakingly collect fossilized corals that grew below sea level during this period but are now embedded in dry land. Leveraging tools from sedimentology, isotopic geochemistry, and paleoceanography, she is able to date the corals and establish critical features of past oceans, such as past sea level, as well as the rate of growth of the coral reefs—an indicator of how quickly the sea level rose. With her collaborators, Dutton combines these field data with modeling of topographic adjustments due to ice melt and ice-sheet gravitational effects to demonstrate convincingly that the sea level during the last interglacial period was at least several meters higher than present. This implies significant melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and indicates that parts of the Antarctic ice sheet may be unstable under current greenhouse gas levels. Understanding how polar ice sheets lost mass and contributed to sea level rise during past warm periods provides insights into their sensitivity to climate changes and improves prognostic models for ice sheet response and sea level rise in the coming century. Dutton is working to further refine estimates of future sea level rise through her collaboration on the development of a publicly available dataset of standardized coral isotope-based data.

	More recently, Dutton has broadened the scope of her work to include communication to the general public about the risks we face in the future due to sea level rise and climate change. Her deep understanding of the past enables her to visualize and authoritatively communicate the urgent need for coastal communities to plan today for a changing environment. Through both her research and public engagement, Dutton is improving predictions of sea level rise and providing society with the information it needs to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.

	About Andrea's Work

	Andrea Ghez is an astronomer who has opened important windows of galactic observation by overcoming previous limitations of ground-based instruments. Thermal fluctuations in the Earth’s atmosphere create distortions that prevent even large telescopes from resolving very closely spaced objects. Early in her career, Ghez adapted a technique known as speckle imaging, in which many very short exposures are digitally added, to work more effectively in the infrared spectrum (which penetrates cosmic dust much more readily than visible light). This advance allowed Ghez and others to identify thousands of tightly orbiting binary- and multiple-star systems, previously supposed to be individual stars. Comparing the age and orbital properties of these stars with previously identified, wider-spaced binary systems provides key insights into the interplay of mass, momentum, and magnetism that determines the course of star formation from amorphous clouds of cosmic gas. More recently, Ghez has advanced the use of adaptive optics in the infrared spectrum, in which an “artificial star” is created from ground-based lasers to correct for atmospheric distortions. Using both speckle imaging and adaptive optics on the 10m Keck telescope, Ghez and her colleagues mapped with extraordinarily high precision the movement of a group of stars in the Sagittarius constellation near the center of our galaxy. Through painstaking, long-term analyses, her group and another based in Germany identified a set of stars orbiting a common point at extraordinary velocities (measurable fractions of the speed of light), implying the presence of a super-massive black hole at the galactic center. Ghez has developed evidence that the stars closest to the black hole are surprisingly young. As Ghez continues to improve the spatial resolution and precision of instruments in deciphering the dust-obscured regions of the central galaxy, we will develop a much clearer picture of the role of central, massive black holes in the origin and evolution of the galaxies.

	Angela Belcher is a materials scientist whose research opens new avenues for controlling inorganic chemical reactions. Rather than relying on traditional tools of physical chemistry, such as high temperature, pressure, or metallic catalysis, Belcher has devised a means to use genetically engineered viruses to serve as templates for the synthesis of submicroscopic conductors and semiconductors. As a graduate student, she demonstrated how natural proteins in abalone establish templates for the mineralization of calcium carbonates, the principal ingredient of chalk, to form its extremely hard shell. She followed these observations by engineering peptides that bind with great specificity to semiconductor alloys such as gallium arsenide. Belcher has demonstrated a proclivity for developing new techniques for manipulating systems that straddle the boundary of organic and inorganic chemistry at the molecular scale. In her most recent work, she has genetically modified viruses (strains that only attack bacteria and are harmless to humans) to interact with solutions of inorganic semiconductors, yielding self-assembling metal films and wires with diameters in the low tens of nanometers. The ability to control this self-assembly process may one day lead to the next generation of microelectronics or other nanoscale machines.

	About Angela's Work

	Angela Duckworth is a psychologist whose studies are clarifying the role that intellectual strengths and personality traits play in educational achievement. Duckworth’s work primarily examines two traits that she demonstrates predict success in life: grit—the tendency to sustain interest in and effort toward long-term goals—and self-control—the voluntary regulation of behavioral, emotional, and attentional impulses. A major difference between the two qualities is that grit equips individuals to pursue especially challenging aims over years and even decades, while self-control operates at a more micro timescale in the battle against what could be referred to as “hourly temptations.”

	In her early work, Duckworth and colleagues devised empirical measures of grit and self-control in both children and adults and established their predictive validity for a number of dimensions of success. They found that these traits predict objectively measured success outcomes, even when controlling for cognitive ability. For example, in prospective longitudinal studies, grit predicts final ranking at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, persistence at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and graduation from Chicago public high schools over and beyond standardized achievement test scores; likewise, self-control predicts report card grades and improvements in report card grades over time better than measured intelligence.

	More recently, in pioneering research showing that children can learn and practice strategies for internalizing self-control, Duckworth has turned intuitions about self-regulation into scientifically informed, highly practical approaches to teaching and learning. Currently working to develop interventions that foster self-control in children and implement her research in real-world situations, Duckworth is providing an alternative to the focus on cognitive skills now dominant in American education practice and contributing significantly to a reevaluation of education policies in the United States.

	About Ann's Work

	Ann Blair is an intellectual historian who has introduced fresh interpretations of early-modern European efforts to compile and classify knowledge. In The Theater of Nature: Jean Bodin and Renaissance Science (1997), Blair offers original analyses of the “commonplace” book of a leading Renaissance humanist, constituting his compendium of knowledge of the natural world. She shows how Bodin, motivated to diminish the violent religious upheaval of the times, offered a view of natural phenomena compatible with, and dependent on, shared theological views. In tracing the contemporaneous and subsequent reaction to his book, Blair also explains how it represents an influential methodological intermediate between the textual analysis of medieval natural philosophy and the empiricism of the modern science that replaced it. Her more recent efforts explore the strategies that scholars used to adjust to the information explosion during the Renaissance. She shows that methods of the medieval manuscript culture played just as influential a role in responding to this crisis of information as the new technologies of mechanical reproduction. Placing these responses within the political and religious conflict of the Renaissance, Blair documents historical responses to challenges that, in many ways, resonate with contemporary times.

	Deavere Smith’s performance pieces offer compelling views of urban, racial, and class conflict.  For these pieces, she interviews a series of people connected to a common event or theme.  She then weaves brief monologues together, deftly recreating these people in their own words.  One of her skills lies in creating works that help those who are diametrically opposed to see the viewpoint of the other side.  Her work has advanced performance theory and introduced a new way for the theater to reflect, and reflect upon, society.  Her one-woman shows, Fires in the Mirror (1991), Twilight, Los Angeles (1993), and House Arrest (1997), are part of a series called On the Road: A Search for American Character, which she began developing in 1983.

	Biography

	Deavere Smith is the founding director of the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, based first at Harvard University (1998-2000), and now at New York University, where she is a professor in the Tisch School of the Arts.

	Deavere Smith received a B.A. (1971) from Beaver College in Pennsylvania and an M.F.A. (1977) from the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco.

	About Anna's Work

	Anna Schuleit is a young artist who brings back to life historic sites and structures through her original interpretations. In much of her work to date, she has honored the lives lived within mental health institutions by transforming abandoned facilities into moving, site-specific memorials. Employing such ephemeral elements as choral pieces and seas of flowers, her powerful public works are designed to endure not as objects, but as vivid memories for those who experience the multisensory events she orchestrates. For Habeas Corpus (2000), Schuleit filled Massachusetts’ historic Northampton State Hospital with music; from speakers installed throughout the dilapidated building, a recording of J. S. Bach’s Magnificat poured through windows and doors, stirring a rapt audience of former patients, caregivers, and hundreds of others assembled below. Schuleit drew her inspiration for her next major work, Bloom (2003), from the fact that few psychiatric patients ever receive flowers. To mark the closing of the Massachusetts Mental Health Center’s original building in Boston, she and a corps of volunteers blanketed the structure’s empty hallways with vibrantly colored, flowering plants—begonias, lilies, pink heather, tulips—and played recordings of ambient sounds from the hospital’s former life. A work of conceptual clarity, compassion, and beauty, Bloom drew thousands of visitors to tour the installation and to attend an open forum that Schuleit organized to coincide with the celebration. Exploring the structures and settings of the past, their architecture, and their stories, Schuleit’s work pays tribute to forgotten lives and reminds us of our common humanity.

	About Anne's Work

	Anne Basting is a theater artist and educator demonstrating the potential of storytelling and creative expression to improve the lives of elders experiencing cognitive impairment. Across a variety of formats and platforms—theater, memoir, narrative, collaborative public performance, and academic research—Basting has developed an alternative concept of aging, one that focuses on its possibilities as well as its challenges and views sustained emotional connections as critical to our well-being as we age. 
	Her breakthrough project, TimeSlips, is an improvisational storytelling method in which older adults with cognitive impairment imagine stories and poems in response to inspiring cues. Basting used a collection of poems by the residents of Luther Manor Home in Wisconsin to create and stage a theater piece with the residents in 2000. She then refined and transformed TimeSlips into a formal therapy protocol guided by her fundamental insight that the creation of new stories can be an enriching substitute for lost memories. Basting has since created several theater pieces with elder collaborators around specific themes or community issues. The most ambitious of these, The Penelope Project (2010), grew out of a series of writing, visual arts, and music and movement exercises that imagines the life of Penelope as she awaits the return of Odysseus in Homer’s tale. Other projects, such as Islands of Milwaukee (2012) and The Crossings (2014), have encouraged community engagement, promoted intergenerational interactions, and raised awareness around elder safety.

	Basting’s perspective on aging and the power of stories is changing the perceptions of caregivers, family members, and policy makers around the artistic and creative capabilities of older adults, regardless of age or cognitive status. Her nonprofit, TimeSlips Creative Storytelling, offers online and in-person training programs and has helped long-term care facilities and caregivers around the world implement TimeSlips. Through performances and scholarship about the development and efficacy of her approach and theater projects, Basting is widening the reach of her artistic advocacy and ensuring that all citizens age with vital human connection.

	About Annette's Work

	Annette Gordon-Reed is a legal scholar and historian whose persistent investigation into the life of an iconic American president has dramatically changed the course of Jeffersonian scholarship. Fascinated from childhood by the Jefferson family, Gordon-Reed began a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence about the rumored committed relationship between Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings. Independent of her responsibilities as a law professor, she wrote her first book, Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy (1997). While the liaison had been widely alleged contemporaneously and since, it was also largely dismissed, then and later, by archivists and historians. Although she is not a formally trained historian, Gordon-Reed drew on her legal training to apply context and reasonable interpretation to the sparse documentation about the shared lives of her protagonists at Monticello, in London, and in Paris. After publication, An American Controversy was received skeptically by some, but her conclusions were confirmed in 1998 when DNA evidence supported the documentary evidence of Jefferson’s genetic paternity. Gordon-Reed has continued her inquiry into colonial interracial relations in The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family (2008), which follows the Hemings family through the nineteenth century and along markedly different paths of racial assimilation and integration. In disentangling the complicated history of two distinct founding families’ interracial bloodlines, Gordon-Reed is shaping and enriching American history with an authentic portrayal of our colonial past.

	About Annie's Work

	Annie Baker is a playwright exploring the complexities of human behavior and the ways in which language is often inadequate to build true understanding between people. With a keen ear for the subtleties of everyday speech, a masterful command of dramatic structure, and a willingness to allow silences to linger on stage (often to a point of discomfort), she brings to life the erratic rhythms of human interaction.

	In several plays set in Shirley, Vermont—a fictional small town—Baker creates seemingly simple stories about ordinary, working-class people facing familiar predicaments. Circle Mirror Transformation (2009) traces the emotional transitions and the relationships forged and broken among five participants in a community acting class, with each of several short scenes centering upon an acting exercise that draws out fragments of the characters' personalities and histories. Baker's use of silence and slow, patient pacing illustrates that we communicate the most about ourselves in the gaps and blank spaces between the thoughts we put into words. The three disenchanted young men of The Aliens (2010), almost of a third of which is silent, inadvertently reveal their vulnerabilities in their verbal tics and cues, pauses and befuddlement. Frustrated ambitions and workplace malaise are themes Baker returns to in The Flick (2013). Idle talk of movies, art, and popcorn among the three young employees at a run-down movie house gradually gives way to tensions around class, race, and gender as their gestures of friendship and intimacy falter. Baker's empathy for her characters and their anxieties is also clear in John (2015), as a young couple grapples with spiritual and philosophical questions in a Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, bed and breakfast run by a friendly but uncanny older woman.

	In mining the minutiae of how we speak, act, and relate to one another, Baker captures the humor, absurdity, and tragedy that result from the limitations of language and our fraught search for more meaningful human connections.

	About Annie's Work

	Annie Dorsen is a theater director and writer producing works that dramatize the complex interface between machines and humans. Dorsen creates what she calls “algorithmic theater,” in which algorithmically determined texts are generated in real time for each performance of a piece.

	Hello Hi There (2010) consists of two custom-programmed chatbots having a conversation using text culled from the transcript of the 1971 debate between Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault about human nature, comments from YouTube videos of the debate, and excerpts from other philosophical writings. As the chatbots’ conversation unfolds live (in both print, on large screens, and orally through computer-generated voices), the question of whether human nature is innate or shaped by external influences is recontextualized within a framework of nonhuman intelligence. Dorsen further interrogates the ubiquity of algorithms—and the implicit biases they enact—in two works that pair algorithm-generated scripts together with human performers. In A Piece of Work (2013), the text of Hamlet is run through a series of algorithms, and Hamlet’s struggles to understand the human psyche find expression in the performer’s task of embodying the character as he recites a soliloquy created on the spot by the computer. The three performers of Yesterday Tomorrow (2015) sight-sing music produced as a computer program gradually transforms the score of the Beatles’ song “Yesterday” into that of “Tomorrow” from the musical Annie. Over the course of an hour, the singers endeavor to keep up with the minute and continuous changes in the music. Their obvious effort and concentration make visible the heedless and tightly scripted pathways of machine intelligence, which increasingly plays a role in many of our daily experiences.

	Dorsen has shifted her focus to the nature of social interaction in the digital world in recent pieces such as The Great Outdoors (2017), in which the incalculable corpus of the internet is juxtaposed with the vastness of our universe. Audience members lie in an inflatable planetarium and watch a display of stars overhead while a performer reads text—sometimes banal, sometimes deeply personal—scraped from chatrooms, comment threads, and message boards across the internet. Dorsen’s investigations of the creative possibilities engendered by the rise of artificial intelligence are challenging the definition of a theatrical event while also encouraging audiences to contemplate the ways in which nonhuman intelligence is profoundly changing the nature of work, culture, and social relationships.

	Annie Dorsen received a BA (1996) and an MFA (2000) from Yale University. Her additional works include Infinite Sun (2019), The Slow Room (2018), and Spokaoke (2012), and she was the co-creator and director of Passing Strange (2008).

In all his published work, he brings fresh and unique perspective, clarity, and intuition to the field. Recognizing the reality of human failures in an imperfect craft, Gawande is equally energetic and imaginative in the identification of practical changes and solutions. Among his innovations are bar codes to prevent surgeons from inadvertently leaving sponges and instruments in patients and a simple score of one to ten indicating the likelihood of complications. Through initiatives at the Center for Surgery and Public Health at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, newly established to study and improve surgical safety here and abroad, Gawande is giving leadership to the identification of numerous other bold enhancements to surgical protocol that will both improve practice and save lives.

	Barbara McClintock was a geneticist interested in natural mechanisms that alter the time and type of gene expression during plant development.

	When McClintock began her studies, genetics was not recognized as a distinct discipline.  Although Mendelian inheritance was well established at the time, little was known of the relation of gene expressions to the chromosome, the carrier of the genes.  McClintock’s goal was to correlate specific modifications in chromosome organization with specific changes in gene expression.  Her pioneering work contributed to the significance of genetics as a field.

	About Basil's Work

	Basil Twist is a puppeteer and theater artist whose experiments with the materials and techniques of puppetry explore the boundaries between the animate and inanimate, the abstract and the figurative. Twist’s works range from productions of classic stories to abstract visualizations of orchestral music and are informed by puppetry traditions from around the world, including hand puppets, bunraku, and string-and-rod marionettes.

	His best-known work, Symphonie Fantastique (1998), uses a complex choreography of fabric, feathers, tinsel, and cutouts in a 500-gallon tank of water to evoke human characteristics and emotions and illuminate Berlioz’s score in unexpected ways. Twist has brought puppetry to new audiences and venues with a captivating beauty and refinement. He tells the story of La Bella Dormente nel Bosco (Sleeping Beauty in the Woods, 2005) with life-sized marionettes, controlled by puppeteers on an overhead bridge, and onstage singers. In Petrushka (2001), he employs meticulously crafted, life-like puppets moved by puppeteers who are sometimes visible (as in the bunraku tradition) to underscore the theme of tragic manipulation in the love-triangle plot. More recently, Twist has returned to his roots in abstraction in The Rite of Spring (2013); he enacts the intensity of both Stravinsky’s score and the response to the original ballet’s debut in 1913 through cascading curtains of billowing silk, crumpled paper, curling smoke, projections, and just a single dancer.

	In addition to his own productions, Twist is a frequent collaborator with renowned opera companies, choreographers, and playwrights, and he has trained and mentored an entire generation of young puppet artists at the Dream Music Puppetry Program based at the HERE Arts Center. Twist’s wide-ranging and trailblazing body of work is revitalizing puppetry as a serious and sophisticated art form in and of itself and establishing it as an integral element in contemporary theater, dance, and music.

	About Becca's Work 

	Becca Heller is a human rights lawyer mobilizing the resources of law schools and law firms to defend the rights of refugees and improve protection outcomes for many of the world’s most at-risk populations. She is the director and co-founder of the International (originally Iraqi) Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), which provides legal services to individual refugees as they navigate labyrinthine application, appeal, and resettlement processes under U.S. and international law. 

	IRAP functions as a nimble, “virtual” public interest law firm that partners with volunteer attorneys who work pro bono on urgent refugee cases, often teamed with law students.  Founded as a student organization at Yale Law School in 2008 to help Iraqis displaced by war safely resettle in the West, IRAP has since established chapters at 29 law schools and partnerships with more than 100 law firms and has expanded its reach to refugees from countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Cases are taken on through IRAP’s field offices in Jordan and Lebanon as well as referrals from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, among numerous other organizations, with a special focus on highly vulnerable individuals, such as children with medical emergencies; Iraqi and Afghan wartime allies; those persecuted for reasons of religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity; and survivors of gender-based violence. Lessons learned through individual cases have also led IRAP to advocate for systemic reforms that benefit broader refugee populations, such as improved Special Immigrant Visa processing for Iraqis and Afghans facing threats because of their service to the U.S. military.

	More recently, Heller and IRAP played a prominent role in responding to the January 27, 2017, executive order restricting people from seven majority Muslim countries from entering the United States. Anticipating the signing of the order, Heller and colleagues alerted IRAP’s vast network of volunteer lawyers to go to airports to assist those who might be detained. Hameed Darweesh, an IRAP client who served as a translator for the U.S. Army in Iraq, became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that resulted in a nationwide stay preventing the deportation of people with valid visas and refugee status.  As the number of forcibly displaced people reaches unprecedented levels worldwide, Heller is working to expand pathways to safety for those fleeing persecution and educating a new generation of lawyers about the importance of access to counsel for those whose lives hang in the balance.

	About Ben's Work

	Ben Lerner is a novelist, poet, and critic exploring the relevance of art and the artist to modern culture with humor, compassion, and intelligence. Lerner began his writing career as a poet and essayist focused on contemporary literature and art. His three volumes of verse capture the often elliptical drift of thought, appearing spontaneous even as they layer linguistic and conceptual complexity.

	Bringing to the novel a poet’s relentless engagement with language and a critic’s analytical incisiveness, Lerner makes seamless shifts between fiction and nonfiction, prose and lyric verse, memoir and cultural criticism, conveying the way in which politics, art, and economics intertwine with everyday experience. Both of his novels, Leaving the Atocha Station (2011) and 10:04 (2014), hold up a mirror to the writer’s consciousness. While Atocha is a comedic portrait of a young artist coming of age, Lerner’s concerns in 10:04 are larger and more pressing, reflecting his narrator’s (Ben) growing maturity in relation to others and keen sense of the social structures that constrain him. Ben struggles to create meaningful fiction in a culture addicted to artificial stimulation, a theme interspersed with acute, at times comic, reminders of the neuroses of American society.

	At the same time, Lerner depicts a complex friendship between a man and a woman. Ben agrees to have a child with his longtime friend Alex, and their experience with assisted reproduction (and Ben’s imagined future conversations with their child) offer a new vision for how people can relate to one other—a glimmer of hope in a world beset by inequality, weather catastrophes, and political upheaval. Lerner is transcending conventional distinctions of genre and style in a body of work that constitutes an extended meditation on how to capture our contemporary moment.

	About Benjamin's Work

	Benjamin Warf is a pediatric neurosurgeon who has revolutionized the treatment of intra-cranial diseases in very young children, with a particular focus on hydrocephalus (“water on the brain”). Many children with untreated hydrocephalus do not survive or suffer significant cognitive disabilities; such outcomes are common in parts of the world where access to neurosurgery is scarce. In 2000, Warf became medical director and chief of surgery at the newly established CURE Children’s Hospital in a remote town in eastern Uganda, where he encountered a high incidence of hydrocephalus. Because traditional treatment of hydrocephalus—insertion of shunts—is both prohibitively expensive and requires sustained medical monitoring beyond the reach of most children in the developing world, Warf pioneered an alternative, low-cost treatment. In carefully designed clinical trials, he demonstrated that a relatively straightforward, one-time treatment using modern endoscopic techniques (based on a surgical approach first attempted in the early twentieth century) results in outcomes that are at least as safe and effective as ventricular shunts, but requires far less medical infrastructure and post-surgical maintenance. As an adjunct to his clinical practice, Warf designed a training program and network for neurosurgeons throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, increasing exponentially the number of children who can now be treated using his method. Having returned to practicing pediatric neurosurgery in the United States, he is now working to expand worldwide knowledge of and access to his hydrocephalus treatment, as well as for other pediatric neurosurgical diseases. Through his research, practice, teaching, and organizing activities, Warf is demonstrating that standards of health care can be improved alongside access to that care, in both the developing and the developed world.

	About Benoît's Work

	Benoît Rolland is a master bow maker who is experimenting with new designs and materials to create violin, viola, and cello bows for the twenty-first century. As a talented violinist who undertook rigorous training steeped in the tradition of nineteenth-century bow design, Rolland brings a unique perspective and keen understanding of musicianship to his work. Prized by contemporary musicians for rivaling the quality of the revered bows of the nineteenth century, his beautifully crafted bows combine the sensitivity, speed, and robust power of the older pieces while also offering new dimensions of tonal brilliance that satisfy the highest artistic demands. Before making a bow for a particular musician, he listens to recordings or live performances in order to create a finished product that perfectly matches the individual player’s personal playing style and also brings out an extraordinary richness of tone and color in the instrument. In response to the increasing scarcity of pernambuco wood, favored by musicians and bow makers for centuries, Rolland began experimenting with alternative materials, including graphite. He produced the first graphite bow of concert quality and added a further design modification in its adjustable camber, allowing musicians to alter the handling of the bow and customize their playing for particular pieces. Rolland’s synthesis of musicianship, historical knowledge, technical skills, and continued research and experimentation ensures that he will be a trailblazer in bow design for present and future generations of musicians.

	About Beth's Work

	Beth Shapiro is an evolutionary biologist who integrates molecular phylogenetics with advanced computational biostatistics to reconstruct the influences on population dynamics in a wide variety of organisms. One line of research she pursues focuses on tracing the population history of recently extinct (e.g., mammoth, dodo) or threatened species (e.g., bison, polar bears). Through statistical analysis of gene sequences, she has inferred the population of several species from a sample of individuals or, in the case of extinct species, from fossilized remains. Shapiro and her colleagues introduced a modification of this population-estimating technique that improves estimation of the statistical error, thus providing greater confidence in her conclusions. She recently showed that a precipitous drop in the bison population occurred before the peak of the last glacial period some forty thousand years ago rather than, as previously believed, with the introduction of human predation, which came many thousands of years later. She is employing a similar approach to polar bears to assess the effects of environmental change on population size and biodiversity, data that are essential to current and future conservation efforts. In a second, more recent, line of research, Shapiro uses her computational analysis of gene sequences to study fast-evolving RNA viruses. Using data collected from individual patients over a period of months, this work may provide key insights into the development of virulence in human pathogens. Through her explorations ranging from prehistoric DNA to contemporary RNA viruses, Shapiro is developing important new approaches for inferring from gene sequences and from the geological record the factors shaping the dynamics of species’ populations. Her ambitious research is enhancing our understanding of fundamental processes such as evolution, extinction, pandemic disease, climate change, and anthropogenic impact on the biosphere.

	About Beth's Work

	Beth Stevens is a neuroscientist whose research on microglial cells is prompting a significant shift in thinking about neuron communication in the healthy brain and the origins of adult neurological diseases. Until recently, it was believed that the primary function of microglia was immunological; they protected the brain by reducing inflammation and removing foreign bodies.

	Stevens identified an additional, yet critical, role: the microglia are responsible for the “pruning” or removal of synaptic cells during brain development. Synapses form the connections, or means of communication, between nerve cells, and these pathways are the basis for all functions or jobs the brain performs. Using a novel model system that allows direct visualization of synapse pruning at various stages of brain development, Stevens demonstrated that the microglia’s pruning depends on the level of activity of neural pathways. She identified immune proteins called complement that “tag” (or bind) excess synapses with an “eat me” signal in the healthy developing brain. Through a process of phagocytosis, the microglia engulf or “eat” the synapses identified for elimination. This pruning optimizes the brain’s synaptic arrangements, ensuring that it has the most efficient “wiring.”

	Stevens’s discoveries indicate that our adult neural circuitry is determined not only by the nerve cells but also by the brain’s immune cells. Her work suggests that adult diseases caused by deficient neural architecture (such as autism and schizophrenia) or states of neurodegeneration (such as Alzheimer’s or Huntington’s disease) may be the result of impaired microglial function and abnormal activation of this pruning pathway. Stevens is redefining our understanding of how the wiring in the brain occurs and changes in early life and shedding new light on how the nervous and immune systems interact in the brain, both in health and disease.

	About Betsy's Work

	Betsy Levy Paluck is a psychologist whose studies of social norms and networks are providing new insights into strategies for reducing patterns of discrimination, bullying, and ethnic conflict in contexts ranging from American high schools to post-conflict Rwanda. By translating theories of social psychology (which are usually developed and tested in laboratory-based experiments) into real-world interventions and randomized controlled field experiments, she has made significant progress in identifying levers for positively influencing individual and group behavior.

	Paluck undertook a year-long field experiment on the use of media to promote ethnic tolerance in post-conflict Rwanda. Individuals were exposed either to a radio soap opera featuring messages about reducing intergroup prejudice and violence or to a control program featuring messages about health promotion. Her results show that to change behavior, it is more important to target individuals' perceptions of social norms than their personal beliefs. That is, an individual's understanding of what is considered typical and desirable behavior in their community could lead to more tolerant behavior, even if their personal beliefs are unchanged. In an ongoing longitudinal study, Paluck and collaborators have engaged nearly 25,000 students in nearly 60 schools in New Jersey in a series of investigations around bullying, harassment, and prejudice. She identified peer ""social referents,"" or students with a high degree of visibility in the school, through a social network analysis based on data from students about who they spent time with either in person or online. She and her team then conducted field experiments and corrective interventions simultaneously to examine how anti-prejudice interventions that target specific individuals diffuse through groups. In addition to confirming the power of peers, rather than adult authority, to spread tolerant behaviors through social networks, Paluck's intervention model led to a significant reduction in harassment and other negative behavior. She determined in subsequent experiments that the behavior change could be traced to perceived social norms.

	Most recently, Paluck has examined the role of institutions in shaping behavior and attitudes. She and colleagues found that after the 2015 Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, there was an increase in perceived social norms supporting gay marriage across the ideological spectrum. Paluck's work has profound implications for the development of policies and tools that can change social behavior for the better and is demonstrating the potential for social psychology principles to address real-world problems on a broad scale.

	About Bill's Work

	Bill Thies is a computer scientist creating communication and digital technologies to advance the social and economic well-being of low-income communities in the developing world. A leader in the field of Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D), Thies combines technical expertise in several subfields of computer science with a deep understanding of the real-world constraints and needs of the communities in rural India he hopes to reach. He overcomes challenges such as stark financial constraints, limited access to internet services, and low levels of literacy by devising interfaces between basic mobile phones, which are relatively affordable and widely used, and modern networks and applications.

	In the 99DOTS initiative, Thies and collaborators offer a new approach for delivering tuberculosis medication and ensuring adherence to the full treatment regimen, which is crucial for preventing the spread of drug-resistant strains of the disease. Patients make a free phone call to an unpredictable number that is revealed when a dose is dispensed from the customized blister package of medication, allowing care providers to monitor patients’ treatment in real time. After successful pilots with 2,500 patients, 99DOTS is currently being scaled up across all states of India. For CGNet Swara, a collaboration with journalists to enable citizen journalism among physically and socially isolated tribal communities, Thies created an interactive voice response (IVR) system that allows users to report or record events of notice via mobile phones. A team of moderators then reviews the audio messages, makes them available for listening by phone and over the web, and, if warranted, brings them to the attention of government officials. Indian officials have responded to hundreds of problems first reported by CGNet Swara, including cases of unpaid wages and an outbreak of cholera in a village abandoned by its appointed medical officers.

	Committed to giving populations in remote locations the ability to both consume and create content, Thies expanded this work into IVR Junction, a cloud-based, open-source tool that enables mobile phone users to record, post, and listen to content on popular social media platforms simply by making a phone call. He is also co-inventor of several low-cost technologies for education, including a mobile application that automatically detects and aggregates student responses using computer vision, as well as an interactive tool that helps translate educational videos into local languages. By shepherding his projects from invention to implementation and evaluation, Thies is providing innovative and appropriate solutions to global social, health, and economic challenges.

	About Bonnie's Work

	Bonnie Bassler is a molecular biologist investigating chemical signaling mechanisms that bacteria use to communicate with each other known as “quorum sensing.” Bassler identified the genetic and biochemical regulatory circuits that control this phenomenon, which was initially thought to be an unusual adaptation in a few species. Her work led to the discovery, by her and others, of similar mechanisms in a wide variety of species. Evidence collected to date has demonstrated that quorum sensing controls a broad range of activities, from bioluminescence to bacterial mating. Some bacteria compete with other species by interfering with their quorum sensing capacities. Others cooperate across species by using quorum sensing to produce complex structures such as biofilms, specialized protective arrangements of bacteria that in many ways parallel the early evolution of multicellular organisms 600 million years ago. Bassler has also identified important biomedical applications for quorum sensing; some bacteria use it to coordinate the secretion of toxins that, in smaller doses, would produce little or no ill effect. Developing medicines that block the quorum sensing activity may represent an important new strategy for treating bacterial infections. Thus, her research reveals new insights into the basic biology and ecology of bacteria, findings that may have direct application in the future treatment of disease.

Many of Jacobs-Jenkins’s plays use a historical lens to satirize and comment on modern culture, particularly the ways in which race and class are negotiated in both private and public settings. Although the provocation of his audience is purposeful, Jacobs-Jenkins’s creation of unsettling, shocking, often confrontational moments is not gratuitous; these elements are of a piece with the world he has established on stage and in the service of the story he is telling.

	Appropriate (2012) has all of the trappings of an “American family drama,” but the familiar plot of a family brought together after a father’s death is disrupted by the discovery of a collection of lynching photographs among the deceased’s belongings. In the characters’ varied responses, past and present racial relations become a palpable presence on stage, despite an entirely white cast. Neighbors (2010) includes performances reminiscent of historical minstrel acts performed by actors in blackface. These interludes lay bare the fraught expectations faced by black artists, a theme Jacobs-Jenkins returns to in An Octoroon (2014) with the meta-theatrical character of BJJ. BJJ is a playwright alter ego who guides the action of this imaginative recreation of Dion Boucicault’s nineteenth-century play of a similar name. Anachronistic acting styles, self-conscious references to the intrinsic artifice of theater, and jolting juxtapositions of the past and present demonstrate the enduring legacies of slavery and the ways in which people can live in close proximity and yet worlds apart.

	With Gloria (2015), Jacobs-Jenkins returns to the naturalistic play, using the biting satire of the comic drama to explore the stratified, competitive world of the modern workplace and its sometimes fatal consequences. In these and other works, Jacobs-Jenkins’s subversive, fearless, and risky approach is challenging audiences to reconsider the integrated spaces we share and to reflect on opportunities for sympathetic connection.

	About Brian's Work

	Brian Tucker is a seismologist whose work focuses on preventing readily avoidable disasters in the world’s poorest countries by using affordable civil engineering practices. He founded GeoHazards International (GHI) after recognizing that multi-story residences, schools, hospitals, stores, and offices built from adobe, stone, or unreinforced masonry in many regions of the world are death traps when earthquakes strike. GHI is the only not-for-profit, non-governmental agency dedicated to preventing structural failures in developing countries. Tucker works on-site with local governments, artisans, and citizens to implement cost-effective measures to construct or upgrade schools and other public service buildings and to educate residents about damage-prevention measures. He is an expert at adapting techniques used by developed countries in risk-mitigation projects so that they fit within the social, political, and economic constraints of at-risk communities in the developing world. GHI’s principal focus on schools is particularly important because their typically poor construction makes them a common source for earthquake casualties. His current work to develop and apply a Global Earthquake Risk Index is designed both to estimate risk and to motivate risk-reduction measures. His efforts have dramatically reduced the potential for death and injury to children and others from earthquakes in vulnerable cities around the world.

	About Brooks' Work

	Brooks Pate is a physical chemist surmounting formidable technical and conceptual hurdles to reveal new insights into the chemical reactions of excited molecules. At low energies, chemical reactions can often be understood by focusing on the interactions of extremely fast electrons around relatively stationary atomic nuclei. The essence of a chemical reaction, however, is the stable spatial rearrangement of nuclei. Pate examines higher energy states where the motion of nuclei plays an important, if not determinative, role in the overall stability and shape of the resulting molecule(s). Much of his work has focused on a special class of reactions in which a single molecule changes the configuration, but not the number, of its constituent atoms. By perfecting spectroscopic techniques such as microwave-infrared double resonance, Pate has teased out the impact of vibrational and rotational nuclear motion on overall chemical reactivity. His research brings us closer to realizing the long-anticipated promise of laser technology for the unprecedented control of chemical reactions.

	About C. D.'s Work

	C. D. Wright is an accomplished writer, the author of ten volumes of poetry, and an editor for Lost Roads Publishers. No single description adequately captures Wright’s work; she is an experimental writer, a Southern writer, and a socially committed writer, yet she continuously reinvents herself with each new volume. The trajectory and growth of her achievement as a poet can be seen in Steal Away (2001), a selection of her verse over the last twenty years. In this volume, Wright experiments with stanza, syntax, and line and writes in a variety of styles—prose poems, short lyrics, and prose narratives. The poems themselves move from the personal to those from One Big Self (2003), where the personae originate from Wright’s conversations with prisoners in the Louisiana state prison system. Despite her frequent use of experimental structures, her mode of expression is clear and accessible, and her poetry is rooted in the landscape and people of her childhood in Arkansas, often engaging issues of social importance. Wright is a prolific poet whose wide-ranging oeuvre includes collaborative projects with the photographer Deborah Luster and the composition and publication of two state literary maps: one of her native state of Arkansas, the other of her adopted state, Rhode Island, where she teaches and resides.

	About C. Kevin's Work

	C. Kevin Boyce is a paleobotanist whose studies of both extinct and living plants across multiple timescales are establishing direct links between ancient remains and present-day ecosystems and advancing our understanding of potential ecological changes as the planet warms. Boyce has emerged as a leader in a new subfield of paleontology that brings patterns of development and physiological processes of extant organisms to bear on the study of fossils.

	In collaboration with colleagues in plant physiology, geochemistry, and climate science, Boyce has advanced interpretations of how major plant components have evolved by using such modern technology as X-ray microscopy and spectroscopy to examine plant specimens at the tissue and cellular level. His studies of leaf vein density demonstrated the development and critical importance of angiosperms’ (flowering plants) high vein density, which allows them to cycle water at much faster rates than other kinds of plants. By incorporating these findings into climate models, Boyce showed that the evolution of angiosperms’ unusual transport capabilities altered and intensified the hydrological cycle of tropical ecosystems, giving birth to the rainfall patterns and lush biodiversity of modern rainforests.

	With these propositions, Boyce is solving mysteries about the morphology of plants that have puzzled scientists for decades and establishing macroecological perspectives of emergent biodiversity, while also challenging evolutionary scientists to embrace new angles of research to advance knowledge and discovery.

	About Cameron's Work

	Cameron Rowland is an artist making visible the institutions, systems, and policies that perpetuate systemic racism and economic inequality. Rowland’s research-intensive work centers around the display of objects and documents whose provenance and operations expose the legacies of racial capitalism and underscore the forms of exploitation that permeate many aspects of our daily lives.

	In a 2016 exhibition, 91020000, Rowland presented a series of objects—including courtroom benches, desks, and leveler rings for manhole openings used in road construction—manufactured by New York State prison inmates, who are paid $0.10 to $1.14 an hour. Rowland also documents the procurement of the items from Corcraft, the market name for the Division of Correctional Industries within the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Corcraft sells the items at below market value to government and nonprofit agencies, meaning, in effect, that such agencies are complicit in perpetuating injustices of the criminal justice system. In a detailed and carefully researched essay that accompanies the exhibition, Rowland traces the history of prison labor programs to the convict lease labor system that developed in the post–Civil War South and argues that the American prison system has descended from slavery. Rowland has devised various ways to implicate and activate the financial systems that historically profited from the oppression of black Americans. Disgorgement (2016) consists of a purpose trust established by Rowland to contain 90 shares of stock from the Aetna company, which profited from the provision of insurance to slave owners for their human property. In the event that federal financial reparations are granted to African American descendants of slaves, the accrued value of the trust will be paid to the U.S. federal agency in charge of distributions.

	Rowland’s institutional critique extends to the art world as well. The first work in Rowland’s 2018 exhibition D37 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, entitled 2015 MOCA REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION, takes the form of a donor plaque accompanied by a narrative accounting of how the museum is the direct beneficiary of practices of redlining based on racial discrimination to suppress property values. Rowland is providing new models for art to engage with justice and, in the process, throwing into question some of the basic premises of Western art, including the edifying power of the aesthetic object and the autonomy of the work of art itself.

	The redlining map of Los Angeles drawn by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in 1939 gave Bunker Hill, block D37, the lowest possible rating. D37 extended from West 4th Street to West Temple Street, and from Figueroa Street to South Hill Street. The report indicated that residents were “low-income level” and were predominantly “Mexicans and Orientals.” The HOLC’s Residential Security Map report for Bunker Hill states:

	It has been through all the phases of decline and is now thoroughly blighted. Subversive racial elements predominate; dilapidation and squalor are everywhere in evidence. It is a slum area and one of the city’s melting pots. There is a slum clearance project under consideration but no definite steps have as yet been taken. It is assigned the lowest of 'low red' grade.

	The Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles was formed in 1948 under the California Community Redevelopment Act of 1945, in conjunction with the 1937 and 1949 federal Housing Acts, which authorized its “slum removal.” The CRA was granted powers of eminent domain to be used in the redevelopment of “blighted” areas. A primary purpose for the CRA’s redevelopment projects was to increase tax revenue for the city. One of the first redevelopment projects proposed by the CRA was in Bunker Hill, on the basis that the neighborhood spent more tax dollars on police, firefighting, and healthcare than it generated. A CRA pamphlet promoting the project stated, “Blight is a liability, Blight is malignant, Blight is a social peril.” The CRA’s “slum clearance” project in Bunker Hill was adopted in 1959. Through seizure and through sales under the threat of eminent domain, all 7,310 residential units were demolished and their residents were forcibly removed. The CRA’s slum clearance in Bunker Hill was one of the first redevelopment projects to rely on tax increment financing.

	In 1980, the CRA issued a request for proposals for a project called California Plaza. Proposals were required to include an outdoor pedestrian plaza, a parking structure, and a modern art museum. The winning group of architects called themselves Bunker Hill Associates. The museum outlined in this proposal became The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. In 1983, the CRA offered MOCA a lease on the land located at 250 South Grand Avenue for a ninety-nine- year term at no rent.

	In October 2015, the CRA sold the land at 250 South Grand Avenue to MOCA for $100,000. One month later, in November 2015, a tax assessment triggered by the sale recorded the value of the land at $8,500,000.

	About Camille's Work

	Camille Utterback is an artist who uses digital technologies to create visually arresting works that redefine how viewers experience and interact with art. Drawing upon traditional media such as painting, photography, and sculpture, she writes computer code that seamlessly blends the interactive elements of each piece with her aesthetic vision. In her 1999 video installation Text Rain, made with Romy Achituv, the interface of video camera and tracking software allows a viewer’s entire body to engage with text. As viewers stand in front of the projection, their shadows interrupt the falling streams of seemingly random words; the words eventually come to rest on the outline of the viewers’ bodies to reveal lines of a poem. With this distinctive and absorbing work, Utterback combines interactivity with a visual and literary experience that captivates people of all ages, including children. While her early work focused on text and movement, in recent years painterly imagery has had a profound influence on a number of her projects. In the External Measures series (2001-2008), she turned the digital medium into abstract pictorial compositions of infinite variety. These dynamic installations react to people’s motions and involve the viewer in the act of creating monumental paintings and drawings. Utterback’s Abundance (2007), a temporary outdoor video projected onto San Jose’s Richard Meier-designed City Hall dome, transformed an impersonal public space and modern edifice into a vibrant, colorful environment responsive to human presence and movement. With each subsequent project, Utterback is creating works that encourage audiences to take part in new and exciting artistic collaborations and enriching the experience of living in a technological age.

	About Camilo's Work

	Camilo José Vergara is a photographer-ethnographer who uses time-lapse images to chronicle the transformation of urban landscapes across America. Trained as a sociologist, he reaches into the disciplines of architecture, photography, urban planning, history, and anthropology for tools to present the gradual erosion of late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century architectural grandeur in urban neighborhoods, their subsequent neglect and abandonment, and scattered efforts at gentrification. Repeatedly photographing, sometimes over the course of decades, the same structures and neighborhoods, Vergara records both large-scale and subtle changes in the visual landscape of cities and inner cities in the United States. Sequences reveal, for example, trees growing in abandoned libraries and decrepit laborer housing swallowed by advancing foliage. Over the years, Vergara has amassed a rich archive of several thousand photographs that are a rare and important cache of American history. These images, monuments to the survival and reformation of American cities, are a unique visual study; they also inform the process of city planning by highlighting the constant remodeling of urban space.

	About Campbell's Work

	Campbell McGrath is a poet whose work is characterized by lyrical skill, intellectual breadth, and humor. 

	McGrath’s most recent work, Spring Comes to Chicago, is noted for its reflective intelligence and comic ebullience. In it, as in his other work, he combines both a personal and an acute historical consciousness as he maps the social, cultural, and natural landscapes of America. His grand vision, raw energy, and keen ear for the subtleties of the modern condition, have led critics to compare him to Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams. Though his work is a reflection of our age and society, McGrath has his own unique voice—an expansive prose poetry that accumulates images and metaphors through the use of symbols and tangible, everyday details.

	Biography

	McGrath is the Philip and Patricia Frost Professor of Creative Writing and a professor of English at Florida International University. He is the author of Capitalism (1990), American Noise (1994), Spring Comes to Chicago (1996), Road Atlas (2001), Florida Poems (2002), and Pax Atomica (2004). His work has been published in such literary magazines as the Paris Review and the Kenyon Review.

	About Carl's Work

	Carl Haber is an experimental physicist developing new technologies for preservation of inaccessible and deteriorating sound recordings. A vast amount of the world’s cultural heritage has been captured on fragile or obsolete recording media such as wax cylinders; shellac, lacquer, and metal discs; and tinfoil. Collections of experimental, musical, ethnographic, and historic content in libraries and museums around the world can no longer be regularly accessed by the public and are in danger of being lost forever.

	Using insights from his work on imaging subatomic particle tracks in high-energy physics experiments, Haber and colleagues developed IRENE (Image, Reconstruct, Erase Noise, Etc.), a non-contact method for extracting high-quality sound from degrading or even broken analog recordings on two- or three-dimensional media. A disc or cylinder is placed in a precision optical metrology system, where a camera following the path of the grooves on the object takes thousands of images that are then cleaned to compensate for physical damage; the resulting data are mathematically interpolated to determine how a stylus would course through the undulations, and the stylus motion is converted into a standard digital sound file.

	Sensitive to the importance of cultural stewardship and archival institutions’ mandate to both preserve and provide access to these historic recordings, Haber has collaborated with archivists and researchers in the United States and abroad to test IRENE on a variety of recording media. The method has been used to successfully play several recordings for the first time, including an 1860 phonautogram, the oldest known sound recording of a human voice, and the only known recording of Alexander Graham Bell’s voice. Currently working to enable mass digitization by making the technology more affordable, portable, and flexible, Haber is poised to revolutionize the preservation of rare, damaged, and deteriorating sound recordings of immense value to our cultural heritage.

	About Carl's Work

	Carl Woese was a biologist who studied the evolution of microorganisms and the origins of life.

	Woese was the first to develop a technology capable of determining evolutionary relationships among all prokaryotes.  The result was the identification of archaebacteria as the so-called “third form of life,” completing the first universal phylogenetic tree relating all extant life.  Using ribosomal RNA sequence as an evolutionary measure, his laboratory provided a phylogenetically valid system of classification for prokaryotes; the revised classification of the archaebacteria was a product of these studies.  His research later focused on defining ancestral gene families, determining the evolution of cellular translation, and tracing the origin of the genetic code.

	Biography

	Woese held the Stanley O. Ikenberry Chair in Microbiology in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where was on the faculty from 1964, and was appointed to the UI Center for Advanced Study in 1989.  He was the author of numerous scientific articles published in such journals as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Systematic and Applied Microbiology, Science, and Nature.

	About Carlos' Work

	Carlos D. Bustamante is a population biologist who mines DNA sequence data for insights into the dynamics and migration of populations and the mechanisms of evolution and natural selection. In studies of humans, Bustamante analyzes SNPs (sites of common variation in a DNA sequence) from many individuals to infer changes in human populations and their relationship to specific gene mutations. He compared SNPs in regions of DNA that are translated into proteins with those in non-coding regions of the genome; from this analysis, he inferred that between a third and a half of mutations that change protein composition are lethal or produce weak negative selection, generating further understanding of a long-standing question of population genetics. He has applied SNP-based methods to retrace the history of species’ domestication, both plants and animals; collaborative investigations of Asian rice and dogs, for example, have provided clues about where and how long ago humans domesticated these species. Bustamante has also teased out higher-resolution reconstructions of human demographic and migration patterns using new data sets from ethnically and geographically diverse samples. He and his colleagues have used DNA markers to assess the impact of shared language and geographic obstacles on migration patterns and genetic composition of human subpopulations in Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Through his multifaceted research, Bustamante is developing a rigorous, quantitative foundation for addressing fundamental questions about genetics and evolution across species, about patterns of population migration, and about the complex origins of human genetic diversity, before recorded history and since.

	About Carol's Work

	Carol Padden is a linguist whose research focuses on the unique structure and evolution of sign languages—how they differ from spoken language and from each other—and on the specific social implications of signed communication. Sign languages, with rare exceptions, are not transliterations of a voiced language but rather have internal structure with their own vocabulary, syntax, and grammar (e.g., using placeholders in visual space and movement of signs to convey subject, object, and verb). In her early research on American Sign Language, Padden clarified misconceptions about the grammatical use of visual space, showing, for example, how signers use points in space to refer to different subjects. More recently, Padden and colleagues determined that Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL), a new sign language, makes greater use of the signer’s own body to show the subject of the verb, as opposed to using space in front of the signer. Although the various sign languages in use around the world are relatively young and rapidly developing, Padden and her colleagues have demonstrated that emerging languages, even if not yet mature, can nonetheless quickly adopt complex grammatical structures such as grammatical subject and word order, calling into question long-held beliefs about natural language progressing from simple to complex. Much of Padden’s work also focuses on the social context of signed languages, such as language acquisition and evolution in culturally and geographically diverse populations (e.g., Israeli Sign Language) versus isolated, tight-knit communities (e.g., ABSL). She also writes extensively about historical factors impacting the development and use of sign language, contemporary obstacles to interaction and integration of deaf culture within larger society, and the underappreciated heterogeneity within deaf cultures (such as the different ways in which deaf people learn sign language and interact with other deaf people). Through her fundamental linguistics research and her reflections on the relationship between language and culture, Padden demystifies sign language and opens windows of understanding regarding how languages evolve over time and the role of language in building and maintaining communities.

	Carrie Mae Weems is a photographer and video installation artist examining the complex and contradictory legacy of African American identity, class, and culture in the United States. Her intimate depictions of children, adults, and families in simple settings document and interpret the ongoing and centuries-old struggle for racial equality, human rights, and social inclusion in America.

	In images that are lyrical and evocative, Weems unites critical social insight with enduring aesthetic mastery. Her signature works over three decades—Ain’t Joking (1987), The Kitchen Table Series (1990), From Here I Saw What Happened and I Cried (1995), The Louisiana Project (2004), Roaming (2006)—juxtapose the harsh realities of race, class, and gender discrimination with the dignity and resilience of the human character in everyday life. She enriches the traditional black-and-white cinéma vérité style with African American folklore, multimedia collage, and experimental printing methods, and in many of her prints, she casts herself as silent witness and guiding avatar through “fictional documentaries” in contemporary surroundings or historical recreations. Resurrecting lives and legacies invisible in plain sight, familiar but unseen, Weems creates a poignant and revealing visual archive of the human condition.

	Recently, she has extended her talent to social reform efforts in Syracuse, New York, with projects such as Operation Activate, a public art campaign to create awareness of an initiative to stop gun violence, and the Institute of Sound and Style, a pilot summer program that engages local youth in experiential training in visual art.

	About Charles' Work

	Charles Steidel is a cosmologist who has substantially expanded our capacity to detect galaxies at the end of the universe. By virtue of the ubiquitous expansion of the universe, distant objects move away from us faster than nearby ones, and their light is consequently more shifted to the red by the Doppler effect. Shortly after completing his graduate studies, Steidel developed a highly sensitive method to identify red-shifted objects by detecting differential absorption of shorter wavelength light by interstellar hydrogen. Because light travels at a finite speed, observations over vast distances also take the observer back in time. By improving the ability to detect objects to the edge of the visible universe, Steidel has provided astronomers the means to explore with much greater sensitivity the early processes in the cosmos that led to the distribution of galaxies in the contemporary universe. In addition, he is putting to observational test competing theories of how the process of star formation has evolved through time. By developing innovative methodology and making careful measurements, Steidel continues to enhance our understanding of the early history of the universe.

	About Cheryl's Work

	Cheryl Hayashi is a biologist working at the interface of phylogenetics, biomechanics, and materials science to study the architecture, structure, and function of spider silks. Some species of spiders produce as many as six different silks, each with specific mechanical properties and functions; the protein structure of these silks consists of highly repetitive amino acid groups (with variations in these groups accounting for differences in tensile strength and elasticity of the various thread types). Hayashi investigates the molecular genetic basis within the genome and in the mRNA transcript that gives rise to the repetitive amino acid structure. Her analyses across numerous orb-weaving spider species call into question long-held beliefs about the independent evolution of this behavior. In addition, her examination of sequence differences between individuals of the same species suggests a “modular” mechanism for genetic variation and selection. More recently, Hayashi has expanded her studies to include silks from other arthropods (such as caterpillars), non-silk proteins such as glues, and comparative analysis of spider silk biomechanics. Her findings, already advancing our understanding of spider phylogenetics, also have the potential to influence the development of biomimetic material for a variety of applications, from biodegradable fishing lines to medical sutures to protective armor cloth. With a deep understanding of spider biology, Hayashi is contributing to a fundamental rethinking of arachnid phylogeny and revealing key information about spider silks to support the development of new synthetic materials.

	Cheryl Rogowski is reinventing the role of the family farm in America. Under great pressure from consolidation in industrial agriculture and shifting trade policies, Rogowski overhauled her family farm, moving away from a single-crop specialization to provide a variety of vegetables and fruits that serve the needs of regional and specialty markets (where the demand is often not high enough to attract the attention of the agricultural giants). Though commercial survival and success have depended on innovation in cultivation, capital investment, and marketing, Rogowski recognized that the health of her business depends even more on the vitality of the marketplace. She has been at the vanguard of creating and participating in Community Supported Agricultural programs (CSAs) in her own community and in New York City and in experimenting with individual CSAs for targeted groups as disparate as Hispanics, seniors, and soup kitchens. She also plays a key role in the New Farmer Development Project, mentoring immigrant farmers seeking to establish their own farms. Other efforts, such as literacy programs for migrant farm workers and public art exhibitions in support of local foods, demonstrate her commitment to finding contemporary solutions to the challenges facing family farms in the United States. Rogowski is an entrepreneur who has revitalized the character of family farming as a commercial enterprise and as an engine of community development.

	Chimamanda Adichie is a young writer who illuminates the complexities of human experience in works inspired by events in her native Nigeria. Adichie explores the intersection of the personal and the public by placing the intimate details of the lives of her characters within the larger social and political forces in contemporary Nigeria. Dividing her time over the last decade between the United States and Nigeria, she is widely appreciated for her stark yet balanced depiction of events in the post-colonial era. In her most recent novel, Half of a Yellow Sun (2006), Adichie unflinchingly portrays the horror and destruction of the civil war following the establishment of the Republic of Biafra. Using multiple narrative voices, a precise movement back and forth in time, and prose that is at once witty and empathetic, she immerses the reader in the psyches of her characters, whose loyalties to each other and their ideals are tested as their world gradually falls apart. In humanizing the Biafran tragedy, Adichie’s novel has enriched conversation about the war within Nigeria while also offering insight into the circumstances that lead to ethnic conflict. A writer of great promise, Adichie’s powerful rendering of the Nigerian experience is enlightening audiences both in her homeland and around the world.

	About Chris' Work

	Chris Thile is a young mandolin virtuoso and composer whose lyrical fusion of traditional bluegrass with elements from a range of other musical traditions is giving rise to a new genre of contemporary music. With a broad outlook that encompasses progressive bluegrass, classical, rock, and jazz, Thile is transcending the borders of conventionally circumscribed genres in compositions for his own ensembles and frequent cross-genre collaborations. Although rooted in the rhythmic structure of bluegrass, his early pieces for his long-time trio, Nickel Creek, have the improvisatory feel of jazz; his current ensemble, Punch Brothers, evokes the ethos of classical chamber music even while adhering to the traditional instrumentation of the bluegrass quintet. The Blind Leaving the Blind, a song suite on Punch Brothers’ first album (Punch, 2008), extends the sound of bluegrass in its range of harmonies and polyrhythms. Thile further explores the symphonic dimensions of the string quintet in both the improvised and elaborately composed works of Antifogmatic (2010). Among his many collaborations, Thile has expanded the reach of the mandolin in Ad Astra per Alas Porci (2009), a three-movement mandolin concerto, and in his solo mandolin interpretations of Bach’s works for violin, which showcase his technical mastery and fluid, soulful phrasing. Through his adventurous, multifaceted artistry as both a composer and performer with various ensembles, Thile is creating a distinctly American canon for the mandolin and a new musical aesthetic for performers and audiences alike.

	Christopher Beard is a paleontologist who investigates the evolutionary origins of mammals, especially primates.

	One line of Beard’s research attempts to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among early radiations of mammals through North America.  As a student, he offered the hypothesis that an extinct group of mammals—the plesiadapiforms—used gliding for locomotion.  This characteristic links the group more closely to modern flying lemurs than to modern primates, and suggests that they were not direct predecessors of primates (as previously thought) but rather shared a common ancestor with them.  In China, Beard has identified tiny fossils that may be remains of anthropoid primates, predating the earliest known African form; this led him to postulate that early anthropoids originated in Asia rather than Africa.

	About Christopher's Work

	Christopher Ré is a computer scientist democratizing big data analytics through theoretical advances in statistics and logic and groundbreaking data-processing applications for solving practical problems. Ré has leveraged his training in databases and deep knowledge of machine learning to create an inference engine, DeepDive, that can analyze data of a kind and at a scale that is beyond the current capabilities of traditional databases.

	DeepDive analyzes “dark data”—or the mass of unprocessable data buried in texts, illustrations, images, etc.; it then extracts relationships among entities (i.e., real-world objects) in the data and infers facts involving those entities. These facts, or assertions, form a knowledge base, which can then be integrated into an existing database. DeepDive has proved to be more accurate than human annotation, and it can be “trained,” even by users without computer science expertise, to improve the quality of results through simple domain-specific rules and low-level feedback about correct or erroneous predictions. Ré is also working to overcome the technical challenge of computing the many possible interpretations of each data item with speed and efficiency. He has made significant advances in Incremental (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (IGD) and has prototyped Hogwild!, which enables data analysis on a multicore machine, and Bismarck, which integrates various analytical tasks into a traditional database system without the need for separate code paths.

	These improvements have led to the application of DeepDive in a wide range of settings, from scientific laboratories to law enforcement. For example, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase extracts data about the relationships among genes, diseases, and drugs from biomedical literature to create an understanding of interactions between genes and drugs in the body—information that is critical for drug discovery. A current DARPA program is using DeepDive to extract data about human trafficking networks from the dark web. Ré’s work across theory and practice, and commitment to creating open-source code that can be integrated into more inclusive architectures or applied systems, is revolutionizing our ability to make this new world of big data truly accessible and widely useful.

	About Cindy's Work

	Cindy Sherman is a visual artist whose work has been central to critical discussion of the arts.

	Sherman’s photographs of herself in different costumes and poses challenge the way we think about identity, social stereotypes, and artistic representation.  Her approach is constantly evolving.  In the late 1970s she made fictional black-and-white film stills that evoke B-movie versions of middle-class white America in the 1950s.  In the 1980s she satirized high fashion in photos that used garish lighting, makeup, and poses, then experimented with portraiture by casting herself—with exaggerated imperfections—in photographs that evoke classical paintings from David to Goya.  Sherman’s more recent works use mannequins to make statements about representations of the body.

	Biography

	Sherman’s work has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad, at such institutions as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid.  Untitled Film Stills (1990), History Portraits (1991), Cindy Sherman 1975-1993 (1993), and the feature-length film Office Killer (1997), for which she served as director, are the most complete documentations of her work.

	Claire Kremen is a conservation biologist whose applied research advances the fields of ecology, biodiversity, and agriculture. As a leader of a conservation planning initiative in Madagascar, Kremen has used adaptive management and predictive mapping to design and establish protected and multiple-use areas in Masoala National Park, Madagascar’s largest nature reserve. Her current work in Madagascar includes forecasting deforestation and its impact on species distribution and development of a web-based repository that will provide researchers with up-to-date biodiversity data and analytical tools needed for conservation planning and monitoring. In other research in the U.S., at the intersection of agriculture and biodiversity, Kremen explores the behavior of diverse native pollinators (primarily bees) and the environments that sustain them. By analyzing the behavior patterns of bees, Kremen investigates an often overlooked but critical component of the global food web, as more than half of all flowering agricultural crops involve natural pollinators. She measures several key variables, including geographic distribution of natural habitats, the diversity of insect pollinators, and the delivery of pollination services. Her results indicate that the ability of a community of native bees to pollinate farm crops adequately is dependent on their access to natural habitats, underscoring the importance of restoring and protecting natural environments on farms. Through new methods that improve our ability to measure, manage, and conserve natural systems domestically and internationally, Kremen demonstrates the dependence of sustainable agroecology on effective environmental preservation.

	About Claire's Work

	Claire Tomlin is an aviation engineer who focuses on developing methods for analyzing hybrid control systems and applying these results to practical problems. Hybrid systems consist of interacting discrete and continuous elements, such as in power plants where there are a series of open or closed valves (discrete) and varying water temperatures or pressures (continuous). Much of Tomlin's research concentrates on aeronautical applications of hybrid systems research, particularly aircraft flight control and air traffic conflict resolution. As the number of variables increases and their interactions become more complex, it becomes ever more difficult to guarantee that systems will always be within safe limits. Tomlin has developed practical algorithms for determining when unsafe conditions may arise, and for establishing feedback control laws for a hybrid system guaranteed to remain within a safe subset of all reachable states. This result holds broad applications for other hybrid systems such as military operations, business strategies, and power grid control. Tomlin is also extending her research to issues of autonomous multi-vehicle control and control theory of differentiation and development in biological tissues.

	About Claudia's Work

	Claudia Rankine is a poet illuminating the emotional and psychic tensions that mark the experiences of many living in twenty-first-century America. Over the course of five poetry collections, Rankine has adopted different forms of poetic expression that correspond to the trajectory of her concerns from the private to the public. Rankine’s abstract and broken syntax in The End of the Alphabet (1998) dramatizes the speaker’s struggle to find language commensurate with her grief. In Plot (2001), interwoven fragments of lyric verse, dialogue, and prose register the disruptions to identity and artistic production that arise with pregnancy and motherhood.

	With Don’t Let Me Be Lonely (2004) and Citizen (2014), both subtitled “An American Lyric,” Rankine uses a more accessible and pluralistic approach to portray how external, public forces in American life can impinge on one’s emotional state. She blends verse and prose in short paragraphs interspersed with images of static-filled television screens in Lonely in order to explore the isolation, despair, and anger of a post-9/11 culture filtered through the media. In Citizen, Rankine’s aesthetic evolution culminates in a powerful poetics, at once visual and documentary, as she brings to life a series of everyday occurrences tinged with racism directed toward African Americans: from slips of the tongue and suspicious looks, to empty seats on the train next to black men, to complaints about affirmative action. The indeterminacy of the “you” in the poems, which puts the reader in the position of both victim and perpetrator, combined with the taut, linguistic compression of Rankine’s verse, convey the heavy toll that the accumulation of these day-to-day encounters exact on black Americans.

	In addition to her poetry, Rankine has become a critical voice in current conversations about racial violence through essays, lectures, and a co-created series of short films entitled Situations. Rankine is crafting critical texts that are proving to be essential for understanding American life while also enriching the craft of poetry with a new sense of agency and urgency.

	About Clifford's Work 

	Clifford Brangwynne is a biophysical engineer enhancing our understanding of cellular compartmentalization and its critical role in biological development. It has long been asserted that processes that drive cellular development—such as protein synthesis, energy production, cell cycle control, and waste degradation—require compartmentalizing the components that perform them into membrane-bounded organelles. Brangwynne’s research focuses on the less well-understood membraneless organelles—loose assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids that are not enveloped by a lipid membrane.

	Using the principles of soft matter physics and cell biology, he determined that the organization of membraneless organelles is achieved through phase transitions. These liquid-liquid partitioning events are akin to oil separating from water—differences in viscosity, surface tension, and other properties allow liquids to coexist in distinct phases without mixing. Brangwynne is developing methods to further explore the mechanisms and implications of liquid phase transitions associated with such bodies as P-granules, Cajal Bodies, and nucleoli. He used changes in cell volume and variances in nucleolar protein concentration that happen during organismal development to study the dynamics of liquid phase partitioning of nucleoli, which are important for regulating gene expression. More recently, he created an approach using light-sensitive proteins that enables precise spatiotemporal control over liquid phase separation of intracellular liquid droplets both in vitro and in living cells. 

	Brangwynne’s findings have opened a host of new research avenues, as membraneless biological phase separation is being found in an ever-increasing variety of cellular settings, and his investigations of the critical role compartmentalization plays in intracellular events has the potential to shed light on biochemical malfunctions that can lead to disease.

	About Colin's Work

	Colin Camerer is a pioneering economist whose research challenges assumptions about human behavior in the traditional models used by economists. Particularly adept at designing original and effective empirical experiments to explore and refine economists’ predictive models, Camerer’s seminal studies provide strong evidence of the inconsistencies between classical economic principles of rationality and observed choices and behavior of real people, leading to new theories.

	Camerer was an early architect of behavioral game theory, which relies on experimental science to model human decision making in strategic and competitive situations such as bargaining, bluffing, and signaling, and he continues to push the boundaries of economic methodology as a leader of the emerging field of neuroeconomics. Publishing widely throughout social science, including in journals in economics, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology, his recent work combines rigorous behavioral modeling with new technologies, such as fMRI, to analyze brain activity during economic interactions that require individuals to make guesses about how other individuals will behave. The thought process underlying these guesses influences individuals’ economic behavior and has profound implications for understanding core economic phenomena such as savings, consumption, and asset market bubbles.

	Camerer’s innovative thinking and modeling acumen are fostering an even more nuanced analysis of individual behavior and the practical policy implications of neuroscientific insights about human decision making.

	About Colson's Work

	Colson Whitehead is a young fiction writer who has already published two well-received novels, The Intuitionist and John Henry Days. His first novel demonstrated his skill as an engaging storyteller and a bold experimental writer whose social and philosophical themes speak to the heart of American society. His more recent novel, John Henry Days, solidifies his position at the front ranks of the new generation of writers. This novel, about the life and myth of folk hero John Henry, is a complex, multilayered work of social commentary, folkloric analyses, historical criticism, and contemporary humor. It echoes and expands on the virtues of his first novel: original, descriptive prose, grand conception, each based on an African-American character surrounded by a threatening or potentially threatening white world. His range of characters and sweep of time are impressive, as are the beautifully rendered scenes illustrating the running theme of the individual’s freedom. While racial politics are central to John Henry Days, Whitehead shows how these issues affect everyone, regardless of race. The book, seemingly about the dilemma of race, is also about the dilemma of humanity. His willingness to take the intellectual risks necessary to expand the boundaries of contemporary writing characterizes his approach to fiction, foreshadowing further contributions to American literature.

	Corey Harris is a guitarist, songwriter, and performer who is leading a contemporary revival of country blues with a fresh, modern hand. He is a powerful and compelling singer and an accomplished guitarist whose musical artistry is complemented by serious explorations of the historical and cultural conditions that gave rise to the blues. He demonstrates his respect for the past and his mastery of the Mississippi Delta blues tradition by interpreting the songs of early blues luminaries in new ways, while also creating an original vision of the blues by infusing his music with a broad range of sounds and styles. Beginning with his 1995 recording Between Midnight and Day, Harris has explored acoustic, rural blues styles with increasing success. Subsequent recordings, such as Greens from the Garden (1999), Mississippi to Mali (2003), and Daily Bread (2005), reflect Harris’ reinterpretations of the African influences on American blues through ethnographic research and musical collaborations in Mali, Guinea, and elsewhere. He has demonstrated the boundless expressive power of blues music by weaving traditional styles together with elements from jazz, reggae, gospel, and African and Caribbean folk music. Maturing from interpreter to creator, his imaginative compositions spark renewed interest in the musical potential of the blues. Sometimes forgoing the traditional 12-bar structure and mimetic repetition common to most blues music, Harris forges an adventurous path marked by deliberate eclecticism. With one foot in tradition and the other in contemporary experimentation, he blends musical styles often considered separate and distinct to create something entirely new for the 21st century.

	Corrine Dufka has pursued a career that defies easy categorization. In her efforts to redress human rights abuses, particularly in West Africa, she has worn many hats—psychiatric social worker, documentary photographer, reporter, analyst, justice investigator—each representing a key element in a strategy for improving human rights. After an early period as a social worker in El Salvador, she identified Sierra Leone as a country where she could make the greatest difference. Largely ignored by the rest of the world in the early 1990s, Sierra Leone was ravaged by a protracted civil war in which both sides systematically engaged in mutilation and rape for political ends. In this lawless environment, Dufka intrepidly recorded the devastation, first as a photojournalist covering West Africa for Reuters, then in interviews and analysis commissioned by Human Rights Watch. Her interviews chronicle the plight of victims and the motivations of the perpetrators. By listening carefully to all perspectives, she has earned a reputation for integrity and veracity. Her photographs, distributed worldwide, expose with clarity but not sentimentality the trauma inflicted by Sierra Leone’s conflict. Recent demobilization and formation of a new government have allowed Dufka to turn her attention to obtaining justice for the victims. As an investigator for the U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone, Dufka documents atrocities of the previous decade; she challenges Sierra Leoneans to preserve their recent history both to bring past criminals to justice and to deter future human rights abuse. Her strategy of understanding, exposing, documenting, and teaching, described by many as visionary, has significantly facilitated Sierra Leone’s on-going transition towards peaceful self-governance, and serves as a model for this region and beyond.

	About Craig's Work

	Craig Fennie is a materials scientist combining the tools of theoretical physics with those of solid-state chemistry to discover new materials with desirable electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. Instead of attempting to manipulate the capabilities of previously existing materials, Fennie identifies completely new materials by employing a “first principles” approach based on quantum mechanics, in which they are rationally built up, atom by atom, to possess the needed physical properties. A central line of his research focuses on understanding and controlling the atomic-scale structural complexity that is key in creating new macroscopic properties. One application of this strategy has been to develop materials with coupled electrical and magnetic states, which opens the possibility of digital data storage being controlled electronically rather than magnetically.

	As a theoretician, Fennie predicts the physical properties of candidate compounds and then works closely with experimental physicists to synthesize and test them. He has already correctly predicted ferroelectric and ferromagnetic characteristics of several previously unexplored metal oxides. His theories have indicated, for example, that a europium titanium oxide, when stretched, would exhibit unusually strong coupled electric and magnetic properties; the resulting material could lead to dramatic advances in memory storage capacity.

	In addition to structures that may serve as the basis for future electronic devices, Fennie is also developing strategies to design compounds with desirable optical properties that could help improve the efficiency with which materials capture solar energy. Fennie’s theoretical work is not only laying the foundation for the design of materials with the potential to transform electronics and communication technology, but it could also lead to the creation of new structurally and chemically complex materials with capabilities beyond our current understanding and imagination.

	About Craig's Work

	Craig Gentry is a computer scientist fueling a revolution in cryptography and theoretical computer science through his elegant solutions to some of the discipline’s most challenging open problems.

	In 2009, Gentry published a plausible candidate construction of a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme, answering a problem posed in 1978 and thought by many to be impossible to resolve. FHE makes it possible to perform arbitrary computations (mathematical operations like sum or product as well as more complicated operations) on encrypted data while it remains encrypted and without needing a secret key, and while keeping the individual pieces of data hidden and secure. For example, a web application could prepare an individual’s tax return using her encrypted financial information, without seeing any data in the clear. Although FHE is not yet practical for widespread implementation, Gentry’s breakthrough has initiated a surge of new research globally in computer science as it has enormous implications for making the cloud computing environment more secure and compatible with data privacy for individuals.

	Gentry went on to tackle another longstanding open problem, moving beyond cryptographic bilinear maps (which have been used widely in encryption, cryptographic digital signatures, and key agreement) to multilinear maps. The potential for multilinear maps was described a decade ago, and while applications such as broadcast encryption schemes and unique signature schemes have been discussed, Gentry and his collaborators were the first to publish a plausible candidate multilinear map. In 2013, he and his colleagues leveraged those findings to present the first example of cryptographic software obfuscation, a discovery that is paving the way for the encryption of entire programs while keeping their functionality intact, thereby making it infeasible to reverse engineer the program. Drawing on techniques from mathematics and computer science, Gentry is inspiring not only a flood of practical applications but also opening doors for new intellectual pursuits across the whole of cryptography.

	About Cristina's Work

	Cristina Jiménez Moreta is an organizer and immigration reform advocate who has been instrumental in building a sustained and influential youth-led immigrant movement. Jiménez, who arrived in the United States from Ecuador as an undocumented immigrant at the age of thirteen, is a co-founder (in 2008) and executive director of United We Dream (UWD), a nationwide network of affiliated groups, organizations, and individuals focused on addressing the needs of immigrant youth and families. Through her leadership acumen and strategic vision, UWD united disparate groups around a common identity that has shifted public perceptions of undocumented youth and focused attention on policy issues that affect them.

	A critical and risky early decision for the movement was to have its leaders and members share their personal stories of the struggles of being undocumented (Jiménez herself first revealed her undocumented status publicly in 2004). Putting a human face on the plight of long-term resident children and young adults transformed the negative public discourse around immigrants. At the same time, Jiménez successfully navigated competing interests and constituencies both inside and outside the movement and articulated an alternative vision and policy framework in the face of stalled efforts at comprehensive immigration reform. After the failure of the Dream Act in 2010, she was instrumental in UWD's decision to shift tactics in its efforts surrounding DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) by opting to press for administrative action rather than risk it stalling in legislature. The adoption of DACA (2012) by executive order has enabled thousands of eligible youth to live without fear of deportation, obtain work permits and driver's licenses, open bank accounts, and go to college.

	In addition to mobilizing political pressure, UWD works to address the needs of all immigrant youth, regardless of status. As part of that effort, Jiménez has facilitated an inclusive, dynamic, and membership-driven network structure within UWD. UWD is recognized as a leadership pipeline, offering immigrant youth an entry point to professional and leadership positions as well as education and training for assuming management roles. UWD also connects its work with that of other social justice movements and has forged alliances with LGBTQ, black, and other racial justice and immigration reform communities. Jiménez is a powerful force in the immigrant rights movement, and she is steering UWD in its mission to provide resources and support to immigrant youth and communities of color while striving, in the long term, to make inroads on immigration policy reform.

	About D. Holmes' Work

	D. Holmes Morton is a unique amalgam of country doctor and research physician whose model for diagnosis and treatment of hereditary metabolic disease is redefining research, prescriptions, and outcomes in the field of pediatric genetics. From his Clinic for Special Children, a primary care facility in a farming community in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, Morton treats Amish and Mennonite children afflicted with genetic diseases. He has successfully reduced child mortality in this isolated community by combining state-of-the-art medical care with dedicated, personal attention and extensive follow-though. At its inception, the Clinic focused on the treatment of two rare genetic disorders, Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which often leads to coma or mental retardation, and Glutaric Aciduria Type 1, which produces a form of injury commonly mistaken for cerebral palsy and requires immediate diagnosis and treatment to prevent irreversible brain damage. His research findings have influenced the work of many in the mainstream medical community. Indeed, a number of the disorders Morton treats cluster in populations in Europe and in the Middle East, and his Clinic has become an international resource for diagnosis and treatment. Currently, Morton and his staff have begun systematically to investigate and treat genentically based maladies not specifically concentrated in Amish and Mennonite communities, including autism, seizure disorders, and mental retardation, with the aim of understanding better how these more common ailments present in highly isolated groups. In demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of a specialized model of clinical care for treatment of rare diseases, Morton has expanded the possibilities for customized medicine in the service of small communities while simultaneously advancing mainstream modern medical discovery.

	Dafnis Prieto is a percussionist whose dazzling technical abilities electrify audiences and whose rhythmically adventurous compositions combine a range of musical vocabularies. A classically trained musician who absorbed from an early age the multifaceted percussive traditions of his native Cuba, Prieto transposes elements from his Afro-Cuban musical heritage onto a jazz drum kit, incorporating congas, timbales, and the layered rhythmic patterns of rumba and son. Whether performing as a solo artist, bandleader, or sideman, his playing is characterized by a finely calibrated command of textures and nuances and an ability to execute highly complex, polyrhythmic structures with extraordinary speed and precision. As a composer, Prieto melds modern jazz harmonies, Cuban clave rhythms, other Latin and African influences, and funk-inspired arrangements to create works of great stylistic diversity that evoke a broad spectrum of moods. His 2006 recording, Absolute Quintet, showcases both his powerful and propulsive playing as well as his interest in composing for a nonstandard ensemble of organ, cello, violin, saxophone, and drums. The morphing rhythms and time signatures of Taking the Soul for a Walk (2008) further demonstrate Prieto's compositional reach and graceful way of slowing down or speeding up a given tempo. Through these and other recordings, his leadership of numerous ensembles, and additional projects involving dance, film, and opera, Prieto is infusing Latin jazz with a bold new energy and sound.

	About Daisy's Work

	Daisy Youngblood is a sculptor whose figurative forms in clay and cast bronze convey intense emotional complexity. Employing traditional hand-modeling techniques, Youngblood constructs sculptures of animals, humans, and haunting hybrids of the two; among her subjects are hulking gorillas, mournful elephants, horses, goats, and fantastical hawk-women. Rather than distancing themselves as exotic, threatening beasts, Youngblood’s figures evoke a sense of vulnerability, with bodies bent, twisted, and fragmented. She further humanizes these assorted creatures by giving them an inhabitable quality; their eyeless faces and hollow bodies inspire a reaction of empathy, drawing the viewer's gaze inward into an empty space beyond their fragile shells. Her chosen material of the earth itself imbues her work with ancient, archetypal attributes and bears a symbolic relationship to the various mythological traditions her imagery calls to mind. Through their rough contours, scarred surfaces, and pared-down forms, Youngblood’s pieces invite comparisons to both prehistoric cave painting and abstract expressionism, bringing about an unexpected convergence of two dramatically disparate periods of art history. With her aptitude for molding psychological vitality into lifeless clay, Youngblood creates striking contemporary sculptures with immediate, visceral, and enduring impact.

	Daisy Youngblood attended Virginia Commonwealth University (1963–66). Since 1979, she has had numerous solo and group exhibitions both in the United States and elsewhere, including New York, San Francisco and Milan, Italy.

	About Damon's Work

	Damon Rich is a designer and urban planner creating vivid and witty strategies to help residents exercise power within the public and private processes that shape our cities. Trained as an architect, he is committed to enlivening bureaucratic systems and applies a democratic approach to a wide range of projects, including designs for public spaces and exhibitions, civics curricula, and regulatory systems.

	In 1997, Rich founded the Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP) and, in collaboration with a group of other educators, advocates, artists, and architects, developed a roster of programs to engage community-based organizations and public school students in explorations of such topics as tenant rights, affordable housing, and infrastructure design. As part of the Urban Investigations program, Rich worked with high school students to study and create models of New York City's waste and water systems. In the ongoing Making Policy Public program, CUP staff work with artists, designers, and advocacy organizations to create highly accessible and portable fold-out posters that explain policy and social justice issues. Rich's projects have taken larger-scale, three-dimensional forms, as well; for Red Lines Housing Crisis Learning Center (2009), he made imaginative use of the Queens Museum's 1000-square-foot panorama of the City of New York to provide visitors with a physical way to experience and comprehend the contours of the foreclosure crisis. More recently, Rich's focus on place, policy, and design has broadened to include development of more democratic urban planning mechanisms and design and construction of permanent physical spaces. He served as chief urban designer and director of planning (2008–2015) for Newark, New Jersey, a city marked by decades of disinvestment and sustained by traditions of political activism. There he worked with long-standing advocates like Ironbound Community Corporation to begin transforming Newark's waterfront along the Passaic River with public parks, trails, and environmental installations. He also engaged a citywide coalition of neighborhood-based organizations in replacing Newark's unwieldy and outdated zoning and land-use regulations with a user-friendly version (the first revision in over fifty years) based upon goals of environmental justice and accountable development.

	In 2015, Rich co-founded (with Jae Shin) the independent design studio Hector in order to expand the reach of his practice, and he is currently at work on projects in Newark, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Attuned to the many competing interests at play in the urban planning process, Rich's work celebrates visions of communities and residents who are often excluded and advances the roles of design and democracy in civic decisions about urban change.

	About Daniel's Work

	Daniel Jurafsky is a computer scientist whose work establishes the foundations for developing systems that use natural language to interact with people. Much of his research has focused on identifying patterns in syntax that provide clues to the underlying semantic structure of communication. Computational linguists have developed several large, annotated databases (known as corpora) that represent and reflect the ordinary use of a language; many of the entries have more than one grammatically correct interpretation. By identifying the syntactic patterns of a large number of actual sentences (using statistical methods such as Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian analyses), Jurafsky and his colleagues have found that computer parsers can be made more efficient by focusing on the most likely interpretations. He, nevertheless, moves readily beyond the domain of algorithm development into human language production and processing. His collaborative efforts have shown, for example, that words are pronounced more precisely if they are critical to the listener for resolving potential ambiguities. Jurafsky also investigates the patterns of human dialog to identify the hidden assumptions about shared knowledge that are critical to smooth conversational flow. In addition to offering new perspectives for further empirical research into psycholinguistics, Jurafsky's basic research directly enhances the engineering of human-machine natural language systems.

	Daniel Schrag investigates the history and mechanisms of global climate change by combining empirical geochemical measurements with models of chemical and oceanographic processes. 

	Schrag’s investigation of changes in oceanic carbon chemistry revealed that the biosphere essentially shut down several times in the distant past, when the globe was apparently completely covered with glacial ice.  He has also determined that the oceans cooled nearly to the freezing point in the most recent ice age, resolving a longstanding debate.  To study the El Niño climatic oscillations over the last decades and in the geologic past, Schrag uses the isotopic composition of coral shells to assess the state of the ocean at the time they were alive.  His research underscores the dependence of effective environmental policy on a comprehensive understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that shape the biosphere.

	About Daniel's Work

	Daniel Sigman is a biogeochemist who explores the interaction of biomass and climate in shaping the Earth’s geologic history. He is a leader in the use of nitrogen isotopic studies for understanding modern ocean biogeochemistry and for the reconstruction of ocean chemistry history. It has been clear for some years that the varying abundance of stable isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen in oceanic nitrate and in sedimentary deposits reflects changes in the Earth’s nutrients and carbon cycle during previous periods of climatic history. Sigman’s research focuses in large part on determining the role of carbon dioxide sequestration (through death of photosynthetic creatures that drop to the bottom of the ocean). In an important technical advance, he developed an enzymatic method to measure the nitrogen in tiny, unicellular creatures known as diatoms, which are trapped within ocean sediments. By comparing the bioavailable inorganic nitrogen (e.g., in nitrates or ammonium) with organic nitrogen extracted from once living cells, Sigman has been able to construct models of paleoceanographic nitrogen cycling. Using sediments collected from the deep sea floor — both at its surface and deeper core samples — at various water depths and latitudes throughout the world’s oceans, Sigman is carefully reconstructing the quantitative net contribution of ocean biology to the carbon cycle over geological time scales. He and his colleagues are also developing clearer notions of the effects of biomass in present-day carbon cycling. To this end, he has improved the resolution of a method for measuring nitrate flux through sophisticated analysis of the stable oxygen and nitrogen isotopes. Such advances promise to give us an ever-sharper picture of the physical, chemical, geological, and biological forces that have regulated the oceans’ fertility and the Earth’s climate over the past two million years.

	About Daniel's Work

	Daniel Spielman is a theoretical computer scientist studying abstract questions that nonetheless affect the essential aspects of daily life in modern society—how we communicate and how we measure, predict, and regulate our environment and our behavior. Spielman’s early research pursued aspects of coding theory, the mathematical basis for ensuring the reliability of electronic communications. When transferring digital information, sometimes even one incorrect bit can destroy the integrity of the data stream; adding verification “codes” to the data helps to test its accuracy. Spielman and collaborators developed several families of codes that optimize speed and reliability, some approaching the theoretical limit of performance. One, an enhanced version of low-density parity checking, is now used to broadcast and decode high-definition television transmissions. In a separate line of research, Spielman resolved an enduring mystery of computer science: why a venerable algorithm for optimization (e.g., to compute the fastest route to the airport, picking up three friends along the way) usually works better in practice than theory would predict. He and a collaborator proved that small amounts of randomness convert worst-case conditions into problems that can be solved much faster. This finding holds enormous practical implications for a myriad of calculations in science, engineering, social science, business, and statistics that depend on the simplex algorithm or its derivatives. Most recently, Spielman has championed the application of linear algebra to solve optimization problems in graph theory. He and his colleagues have offered a new approach to maximizing the flow through unidirectional graphs, promising significant improvements in the speed of a wide range of applications, such as scheduling, operating system design, and DNA sequence analysis. Through these projects and fundamental insights into a host of other areas, such as complexity theory and spectral theory, Spielman is connecting theoretical and applied computer science in both intellectually and socially profound ways.

	About Daniela's Work

	Daniela Rus is a young computer scientist and roboticist whose research extends from abstract aspects of information processing to practical implementation of self-reconfigurable robots (which have multiple subunits and are able to adjust their spatial interconnections dynamically according to function of the device and in response to constraints of the environment). Rus has not only developed algorithms for coordinating the subunit interactions, she has also demonstrated that they work in functioning mechanical devices. Viable self-reconfigurable machines could be used in many situations where the possible obstacles and constraints on movement could not ever be fully anticipated in preprogrammed control software (e.g., deep sea or planetary exploration). Although her work on self-reconfiguring robots readily captures the popular imagination, Rus’s research extends deeply into other aspects of robotics, such as distributed manipulation control systems, and into computer science, such as information capture and organization. She has demonstrated a capacity to move effortlessly among the most challenging issues in the theory and application of computer science and robotics.

	About Danielle's Work

	Danielle Bassett is a physicist using tools from network science and complex systems theory to enhance our understanding of connectivity and organizational principles in the human brain. Combining a strong background in physics with training and collaborations in neuroscience, Bassett adapts mathematical approaches associated with the study of complex networks (such as computer or social networks) to analyze interactions among neurons in different regions of the brain while a person does certain activities (e.g., learn something new or try to remember a face), thereby unraveling how these connections give rise to the functions or jobs the brain performs.

	With her standard-setting work on graph theoretic characterizations of interconnections within the brain—and, importantly, how those connections change over time and under varying conditions—Bassett determines the specific relationship between network organization and cognitive ability. Using brain imaging data of people learning a motor task over three distinct time periods, Bassett and colleagues found that a person’s ability to learn can be predicted based on the brain’s flexibility, or the ability of different areas of the brain to connect in different combinations, and precision in identifying existing brain functions that can be used to accomplish the new behavior.

	Bassett complemented this work on dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks over time by illustrating how functional connectivity in the brain is modified by memory and language processing, and by psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. With additional lines of research focused on dynamics in social and physical networks, including decision making among large populations during evacuations and sound propagation through granular materials, Bassett is not only revealing new insights regarding learning, disease diagnostics and therapeutics, and treatment of brain injury, but she is also making contributions to disciplines as far-ranging as cell biology, materials science, and social systems.

	About Danielle's Work

	Danielle Citron is a legal scholar addressing the scourge of cyber harassment by raising awareness of the toll it takes on victims and proposing reforms to combat the most extreme forms of online abuse. While she has explored a range of privacy and digital rights issues over the course of her career, much of her work has centered on gender-based discrimination in online environments, where women are disproportionately targeted with threats of a violent and sexual nature.

	In her book, Hate Crimes in Cyberspace (2014), and a series of law review articles that informed it, Citron documents the significant harms caused by various types of cyber stalking, cyber mob attacks, and “revenge porn”—the nonconsensual publication and dissemination of intimate photos or videos, typically by a significant other seeking to humiliate a former partner. Because offensive content often appears at the top of internet search results for a victim’s name and includes email, home, or work addresses, the consequences for victims can include jeopardized employment, education, and housing opportunities; an inability to maintain an online presence; and compromised personal safety. Citron not only analyzes the social and legal structures that make it so difficult to curb cyber harassment but also reframes the issue as a violation of civil rights. She likens dismissive attitudes about the gravity of its harms to similar views from the 1970s about sexual harassment in the workplace. Citron has proposed a variety of pathways for reform both through her scholarly publications and in the broader public realm. She has advised state attorneys general and legislators in efforts to criminalize nonconsensual pornography under existing statutes against stalking and harassment and has worked with technology companies to update safety and privacy policies. Mindful of concerns that an overly broad reaction to cyber harassment would infringe on constitutional protections of free speech, her proposals are characterized by clear distinctions that fit criminal penalties and invasion of privacy claims within the contours of the First Amendment.

	More recently, she has expanded the scope of her work to explore the concept of sexual privacy as a distinct privacy interest that warrants recognition and protection and is foundational to human dignity. Citron’s respect for speech rights and persuasive articulation of the civil rights of harassment victims are spurring legal scholars, lawmakers, tech companies, and the public to view in a new light what many have simply accepted as the inevitable dark side of our digital age.

	About Daphne's Work

	Daphne Koller is a computer scientist who has developed new computational methods for representing knowledge and reasoning at the intersection of traditional logic, probability, uncertainty, and subjective judgment. Her work bridges a longstanding divide in the field of artificial intelligence between efforts to develop an explicit representation of knowledge (for example, in medical diagnosis) and efforts to categorize data based on statistical properties (such as optical character recognition). Koller significantly expanded the utility of Bayesian networks—computational devices for reasoning based on uncertain information—by showing how these structures can be organized in hierarchical, object-oriented networks. She and her colleagues advanced this one step further by developing ""probabilistic relational models"", admixtures of logical and statistical representations that can implement standard deductive reasoning without exhibiting the fragility of earlier systems to incorrect, incomplete, or uncertain inputs. Probabilistic relational models are capable of extracting knowledge embedded in large databases into a form that can be used for abstract reasoning. These advances find direct application in areas such as commerce, security, and biomedical research; for example, probabilistic relational models have been used to analyze the yeast genome, identifying regulatory roles for several proteins whose function had been previously uncharacterized. Through her research in graphical modeling, Koller has demonstrated the power of probabilistic methods for tackling the hardest problems in knowledge representation, inference, and learning.

	About Daryl's Work

	Daryl Baldwin is a linguist and scholar reviving the linguistic, cultural, and intellectual heritage of the Miami (Myaamia) nation. Forced removal of the Miami nation from their homeland in the Great Lakes region west to the unorganized territory in the nineteenth century scattered the Myaamia people, now numbering around 5,000, across the country and accelerated the decline of the Miami language, which lost its last native speaker in the mid-twentieth century. Through a multipronged approach that is rooted in restoring use of the Miami language, and includes both education and research, Baldwin is imparting important cultural knowledge to present-day Myaamia descendants.

	Baldwin, a trained linguist, utilized historical documentation and the work of linguist David Costa to teach himself and his family the language. Baldwin’s efforts to share his love of the language would develop into community-supported summer youth camps. For Baldwin, however, language is inextricably linked to culture and identity, and language reclamation is a critical tool in his larger efforts to empower a healthy and sustainable Myaamia community. To that end, he has helped forge a unique and mutually beneficial tribal-academic partnership with Miami University in Ohio through the Myaamia Center (formerly the Myaamia Project). Jointly directed and funded by the university and the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, the center undertakes research for the preservation and rediscovery of Myaamia ways of knowing, including projects focused on harvesting practices and seasonal activities and diets; mapping the landscape and land uses of the traditional homeland; reconstructing the traditional Myaamia lunar calendar; documenting Myaamia ethnobotany practices; and development of curricula and training materials for teaching and learning the Miami language. The center also offers educational opportunities for both tribal members and the larger student body of the university.

	Baldwin is a mentor and inspiration for other indigenous groups undertaking language revitalization efforts through the National Breath of Life workshops, which provide guidance for accessing and using archival materials held in D.C.-based archives and libraries. Through his long-term, whole systems approach to restoring the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Myaamia people, Baldwin is working with his community and center staff to make available important knowledge and create a hopeful vision for future generations.

	David B. Goldstein is a physicist with a passion for applying his scientific expertise and strategic acumen to improving global energy efficiency. His work, which consistently refutes suggestions of inherent conflict between economic growth and environmental quality, touches on a broad spectrum of energy-related issues—from appliance design, to building construction, to governmental policies in developing industrial nations, to housing and transportation planning—and on developing effective policies to address these issues. Goldstein recognized, for example, that early refrigerators wasted a significant fraction of U.S. electrical output due to poor design. He led the effort to hold an efficiency design contest and then successfully lobbied regional and national regulatory agencies to establish energy consumption standards based on the new design, thus creating a market for the more efficient devices. More recently, he has initiated a project to encourage people, through mortgage lending incentives, to minimize the amount of energy they waste driving unnecessarily. Over the last decade, moreover, he has sought to influence and improve building efficiency standards in Russia and China. Throughout his work, Goldstein draws from his scientific training to eliminate political and economic obstacles to greater energy efficiency, with constant attentiveness to the environmental penalties of energy waste.

Performing the role of the Stage Manager himself, Cromer adopts modern dress and a conversational tone and is simultaneously the omniscient, efficient director and a character in the play. The minimalist aesthetic of the production and his portrayal of the Stage Manager avoid the sentimentality characteristic of other versions of Our Town and, at the same time, increase the emotional force of the play’s exhortation to live in the present moment. From venues in Chicago to the theaters of New York, Cromer is re-staging earlier plays with a spirit and urgency that resonates with contemporary audiences.

	About David's Work

	David Donoho is a statistician whose work ranges from statistical computing to classical mathematical analysis.

	His theoretical work includes the nonlinear recovery of signals despite massively incomplete data; recovery of curves from noisy statistical data in a theoretically optimum manner; and robust methods for treating severely contaminated high-dimensional data.  Underlying this work is mathematics ranging from inequalities in the theory of entire functions to geometric properties of high-dimensional convex sets.  Donoho has interests in large-scale statistical applications, particularly signal analysis in geophysical and medical problems.  In presenting his findings, Donoho not only describes the intellectual underpinnings for his results, he also makes software available for others to learn from and expand his research.  For example, he was a designer of MacSpin, a package that visualizes statistical data as rotating, three-dimensional point clouds; Donoho also coordinated the development of mathematical software tools that expand on his initial work in wavelet theory.

	About David's Work

	David Finkel is a journalist whose finely honed methods of immersion reporting and empathy for often-overlooked lives yield stories that transform readers’ understanding of the difficult subjects he depicts. As a staff writer for the Washington Post, he has reported from the Middle East, Africa, Central America, Europe, and across the United States and covered a wide spectrum of complex topics: the plight of refugees during the conflicts in Kosovo, worldwide patterns of illegal migration, a failed experiment in democracy building in Yemen, and, most notably, the counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq. In an effort to push beyond the constraints and conventions of traditional news writing, he wrote The Good Soldiers (2009), a gripping, book-length chronicle of the eight months he spent embedded with a U.S. Army infantry battalion deployed to one of the most dangerous areas of Baghdad as part of the “surge” of troops sent to Iraq in 2007. With a spare and distinctive writing style that incorporates the language and rhythms of speech of his subjects, Finkel chronicles the character transformations of a group of young men as they experience the horrors of combat. The narrative he weaves together from his months of eyewitness observation powerfully captures how decisions made at the upper echelons of government are carried out by ordinary soldiers placed in highly challenging circumstances on the ground, beyond the Green Zone, during some of the most intense fighting of the war. He is currently at work on a second book that explores the aftermath of war by following many of the same soldiers and their families in their struggles to resume lives at home. As newspapers continue to contract and move away from immersion-based, long-form reporting, Finkel remains committed to crafting sustained narratives with an uncommon candor that brings poorly understood events and ordeals into public consciousness.

	About David's Work 

	David Green is a pioneer in the manufacture and distribution of advanced health care products for patients in the developing world who could not otherwise afford them. He organizes engineers, technical experts, distribution partners, and financiers to create production facilities capable of making high-quality products at very low cost. In India, Green established Aurolab to manufacture intraocular lenses (IOLs)—plastic implants used to restore sight to patients suffering from cataracts and other eye diseases. On a self-sustaining basis, Aurolab produces hundreds of thousands of lenses annually at a fraction of the costs in developed countries and distributes them in more than 85 countries. The company is now one of the largest manufacturers of IOLs in the world. By expanding Aurolab’s manufacturing capacity to include low-cost needles and sutures, Green has opened opportunities to restore vision and treat other diseases for millions of people. Green is now developing digitally programmable, inexpensive hearing aids designed to become nonfunctional if any effort is made to resell them in markets other than the intended ones (i.e., those where widespread poverty makes such devices otherwise unobtainable). By applying traditional business strategies in untraditional markets, Green has addressed important public health challenges and improved the lives of populations around the world.

	About David's Work

	David Gross, a theoretical physicist, is a leader in the study of particle physics.

	Gross is among those who originated the heterotic string theory, which has a strong potential for explaining the physical universe.  He has had a major impact on gauge field theory, and was the co-discoverer of asymptotic freedom, the basic feature of quantum chromodynamics, which holds that the closer quarks are to each other, the less the strong interaction between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. Gross’s contributions made possible the completion of the standard model of particle physics, and constitute an important step in providing a unified description of all the forces of nature, regardless of the spatial scale.

	Biography

	Gross was a Junior Fellow at Harvard University (1966-1969) and a professor holding several endowed chair appointments, at Princeton University (1969-1997).  In 1997, he became a professor and the director of the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he was named the first Frederick W. Gluck Professor in Theoretical Physics in 2002. 

	Gross received a B.Sc. (1962) from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a Ph.D. (1966) from the University of California, Berkeley.

	About David's Work

	David Lobell is an agricultural ecologist who unearths and connects richly informative sources of data to investigate the impact of climate change on crop production and food security around the globe. His multidisciplinary background in remote sensing, statistics, ecosystem modeling, land use, and agronomy informs his approach and enables him to draw significant insights from enormous and diverse data sets on weather, agricultural practices, and natural resources such as soil and water.

	For research projects that span major agricultural areas in Africa, South Asia, Mexico, and the United States, he uses a wide array of methods and tools to study how factors such as temperature and moisture have affected crop yields over time and to project the consequences of future climate change on food production. For one influential paper on trials of maize varieties in Africa, he used an untapped wealth of historical data from experimental farms in the sub-Saharan area, which he correlated with records from meteorological stations throughout the region in order to analyze the effect of drought and temperature on yields. Lobell’s findings indicate that maize is much more sensitive to heat extremes and drought conditions than previously understood and demonstrate that even varieties engineered to have high heat and drought tolerances suffer marked yield losses when exposed to temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius. The design of this study has also opened new avenues for related research on other staple crops—such as wheat, soybeans, and rice—in geographic locations in North and South America and Central and South Asia.

	Among the many additional topics he explores are specific adaptations and investments for reducing food-security risks posed by imminent climatic shifts and the environmental consequences of increased food and biofuel production. With the world’s population predicted to reach nine billion by 2050, Lobell’s work is addressing critical questions about how to meet a rapidly growing demand for food across a warming, changing planet.

	David Macaulay is a visual storyteller whose illustrated books demystify the workings and origins of objects as mundane as a stapler and as monumental as a cathedral. While he modestly classifies himself an “explainer,” Macaulay’s elegant drawings, wry humor, and clear descriptions of the simplest and most complex structures and machines are sophisticated and entertaining educational experiences for both children and adults. His profound curiosity has led him to deconstruct human creations to the simple and understandable, as exemplified by his architectural series of books, Cathedral (1973), Pyramid (1975), Castle (1977), and Mosque (2003). In The Way Things Work (1988), a seminal book in the field of illustrated-educational books, he not only shows the reader how things are made, but conveys complex technical information as to how and why they function. While best known for his books on architecture and engineering, Macaulay is also a gifted author of picture books. In his award-winning Black and White (1990), he abandoned linear storytelling to produce a book that challenges young readers to piece together four interconnected plots that unfold through illustrations in separate quadrants of each two-page spread. He is currently engaged in intensive study for his next book, an exploration of the complexities of the human body. Macaulay’s visually arresting and thought-provoking body of work invites readers of every age to perceive the world they occupy from surprising and compelling perspectives.

	David Montgomery is a geomorphologist making fundamental contributions to our understanding of the geophysical forces that determine landscape evolution and of how our use of soils and rivers has shaped civilizations past and present. A prolific and versatile scientist, Montgomery’s numerous publications have explored how landslides and glacial erosion influence the height of mountains, how rivers originate and shape the landscape, and how human modification of river channels affects aquatic ecosystems, among other probing questions about the Earth’s surface. Unsettling conceived wisdom about environmental change at both the local and global levels, Montgomery’s field studies have taken him throughout the Pacific Northwest, his home and research base, to the Himalayas, the Andes, and the canyons of Mars (via data from NASA’s Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter). For one major research program, he investigates the role of sediment and wood debris in altering stream and river channels and develops novel methods for measuring channel stability, anthropogenic disturbances, and conditions conducive to salmon spawning. In King of Fish: The Thousand-Year Run of Salmon (2003), a well-received book on the history of humans’ impact on salmon populations, Montgomery broadens the reach of his field studies beyond the scientific community by distilling his findings to support applied research on the ecological management of mountain rivers. His second book, Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations (2007), chronicles the role of soil in the evolution of ancient and modern societies and offers a number of solutions to contemporary soil degradation worldwide.

	About David's Work

	David Simon is an author, screenwriter, and producer who draws from his background as a crime beat reporter to craft richly textured narratives that probe urban America’s most complex and poorly understood realities. Though Simon has authored a wide range of nonfiction works, both in journalism (as a Baltimore Sun reporter and freelancer) and book-length form, he is best known for his contributions to drama; he has been a screenwriter and/or producer for several critically acclaimed television series, including Homicide: Life on the Street (1993–1999), The Wire (2002–2008), and Treme (2010–). With the nuance and scope of novels, Simon’s recent series have explored the constraints that poverty, corruption, and broken social systems place on the lives of a compelling cast of characters, each vividly realized with complicated motives, frailties, and strengths. Over the course of its five seasons, The Wire presented a panoramic portrait of an American city in an era of economic decline and immersed viewers in the workings of distinct yet intricately interwoven institutions of Baltimore: the inner-city drug trade, law enforcement, the dockyards, city hall, a local newspaper, and public schools. In keeping with his interest in struggling cities and the fates of their inhabitants, Simon has set his current project, Treme, against the backdrop of post-Katrina New Orleans, as a community works to rebuild its neighborhood and culture. His portrayals are sometimes harshly critical, sometimes unexpectedly sympathetic, but always viewed through the lens of a hard-edged, cautiously optimistic realism. Through his nonfiction accounts and television dramas, Simon creates riveting stories that engage wide-ranging audiences and confront some of the most daunting challenges facing America’s urban centers.

Through his collection of biological, archaeological, and cultural curiosities in the Museum of Jurassic Technology, Wilson blurs the distinctions among museum, mausoleum, and library. His installations question what museums are, mean, and do. Fact and fiction are displayed with equal precision and diligence, and natural history items share space with artifacts of surreal technology. His displays challenge perceptions of what is real and what is not, and demand reinterpretations of our understanding of science, natural history, mythology, and vernacular art forms.

	About Dawn's Work

	Dawn Song is a computer security specialist who applies rigorous theoretical methods to understand the deep interactions of software, hardware, and networks that make computer systems vulnerable to attack or interference. Computer security failures can lead to dissemination of spam email, systemic disruption of communications traffic on the internet, and unauthorized access to confidential information. Rather than identifying errors in programming logic that lead to specific security breaches, Song investigates the underlying patterns of computer system behavior that often apply across whole classes of security vulnerability. Using a sophisticated method for semantic analysis of binary code (i.e., the machine-readable translation of human-readable programmers’ instructions) from disruptive software, Song can identify the common path of logic flow that similarly disruptive software must also follow, thus offering a means to protect against an entire set of potential security threats. As a surprising consequence, she has shown that software patches intended to fix existing security flaws can be used as a template for algorithms that autonomously generate similar but distinct computer programs that also exploit the flaw, and sometimes even circumvent the repair. Identifying such weaknesses represents an important step in developing generalized defenses against computer attack, instead of the more common approach of iterative, ad hoc corrections of inevitable human errors in software design. Song also helped to develop an efficient algorithm that can protect the most sensitive information using cryptography, even if a computer system’s first-line defenses have been compromised. By synthesizing advanced approaches from theoretical computer science and empirical software engineering, Song is making significant strides in increasing the security and stability of computer systems and networks, which have become essential elements of our social and economic infrastructure.

	About Dawoud's Work


	Dawoud Bey is a photographer and educator whose portraits of people, many from marginalized communities, compel viewers to consider the reality of the subjects' own social presence and histories. Through his expansive approach to photography—which includes deep engagement with his subjects and museum-based projects—Bey is making institutional spaces more accessible to the communities in which they are situated.

	During a residency in 1992 at the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Andover, Bey embarked on what would become an ongoing series of portraits of high school students. He made his artistic practice more public and accessible, involving the students in shaping their own representations and working in a semi-public studio. The resultant large-scale, multiple-image works are powerful expressions of the youthful subjects' respective individualities, still in the throes of being formed and negotiated. Bey expanded on this project in Class Pictures (2002–2006), a body of work produced in collaboration with young people and institutions throughout the United States. In addition to playing a role in the construction of their psychologically rich portraits, the students provided written texts about themselves to accompany Bey's photographs of them, creating another layer of evocative self-definition. The exhibitions, public programming, and educational outreach Bey conceived as components of Class Pictures turned the museum into a vehicle for creating a closer relationship between institutions, youth, and the communities they inhabit.

	More recently, Bey has focused on the construction of collective history and memory. In The Birmingham Project (2013), he commemorates the lives of six children killed in the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and its aftermath in Birmingham, Alabama, through a series of portraits of Birmingham residents whose ages correspond either to the ages of the children in 1963 or to how old they would have been fifty years later in 2013. In another recent project, Harlem Redux (2014–2017), Bey returns to the site of his first project, Harlem, U.S.A. (1975–1979), but in this instance he focuses on the urban landscape and its transformation spurred by gentrification. Through his own work and long-time commitment to educating and mentoring young artists, Bey is redefining the role of photography and portraiture as active agents in the examination and formation of communities.

	About Deborah's Work

	Deborah Bial is an education strategist who addresses the challenges of college access for underrepresented populations by identifying and fostering latent talent and opening opportunities for them to pursue higher education. Traditional admissions metrics such as grade point average, class rank, and entrance exam scores have long been recognized as inadequate predictors of success for some undergraduates. Through her Posse Foundation, Bial offers an alternative model for identifying promising young people from less advantaged, urban environments. Working with public high schools and other community organizations, Bial evaluates potential candidates using a rigorous assessment process based on qualities such as leadership, teamwork, communication skills, and motivation — qualities that are as critical to successful navigation of undergraduate education as academic track records. The most promising students are invited to join a “posse,” a small group that participates in an eight-month, pre-collegiate training program that builds individual and team skills and serves as an essential social support system once students arrive at college. In parallel, she develops partnerships with admissions officials from dozens of highly selective liberal arts colleges and universities, offering a powerful means to augment the cultural and economic diversity of their institutions. Bial is now refining her model to provide a focused program for students specifically interested in science and medicine. Today, 90 percent of “posse” students graduate, a rate significantly higher than the national average. By demonstrating the importance of less-recognized skills in educational achievement, Bial continues to open doors for thousands of students and to reframe college admissions into a more successful and inclusive process.

	Deborah Eisenberg is a writer of short fiction whose works present an unusually distinctive portrait of contemporary American life. Her exquisitely distilled stories often depict men and women coming to terms with their personal relationships and grappling with the changing social context in which those relationships occur. Through her deft use of dialogue and point of view, she captures subtle shifts in consciousness and makes observations that readers recognize as both true and strikingly original. The hallmarks of Eisenberg’s style — crystalline prose, keen perceptions of emotional nuance, and wry wit — are all evident in Twilight of the Superheroes (2006), the most recent of her four short story collections. In the title story, a meditation on the terrorist attacks of September 11 and their aftermath, a group of young, post-collegiate friends witnesses the attacks from their sublet loft in downtown New York City. Crafting each sentence to deepen readers’ understanding of her characters, Eisenberg juxtaposes the disaster’s lasting impact on the individuals against the ordinariness and routines of daily life, such as working at a job and coping with one’s family. In this story and throughout the entire collection, she reveals common yet often unnoticed facets of human experience with skill, sensitivity, and precision. Devoted to the short story form, Eisenberg continues to produce elegant explorations of the human psyche in tales of increasing complexity, fluency, and moral depth.

	Deborah Estrin is a computer scientist creating open-source applications and platforms that leverage mobile computing devices and network services to address socio-technological challenges. Throughout her career, Estrin has demonstrated a remarkable ability to anticipate the applicability of technological advances to a variety of fields. She made fundamental contributions to improving the scalability and broader utility of the emerging internet through her work on network routing (the process that determines how data are forwarded from source to destination). She then went on to build the foundational protocols for wireless sensor networks—that is, connectivity among distributed autonomous sensors that record conditions in a specific environment. This effort brought together researchers from ecology, environmental science, agriculture, statistics, and computer, electrical, and civil engineering to design and implement networked sensing as an infrastructure resource for such needs as climate and ecosystem modeling, wildlife habitat monitoring, and resource management.

	More recently, Estrin was among the first to ascertain the potential of using the digital traces of our daily lives for participatory mobile health. Our increasing reliance on personal electronic devices, such as cell phones, GPS, and fitness trackers, and online tools such as banking and shopping, generates an enormous amount of data about our personal behavior patterns—what Estrin calls “small data.” In 2011, she and collaborators launched Open mHealth, an open-source software architecture to integrate various types of small data and be used to build customized applications that address specific health conditions. Open mHealth avoids the proliferation of redundant, non-interoperable digital health services, and its scalability encourages wider adoption of mobile health technologies by individuals, researchers, and medical care providers.

	Estrin is also working to empower individuals to gain access to, curate, and ultimately act upon their personal small data. She and colleagues at the Small Data Lab are developing several platforms and applications for management and use of personal data, including: user-driven personalization, in which personal data traces from one platform are used to make content recommendations in another in order to reduce popularity-bias; and retrospective data learning to generate personalized models that can identify changes in an individual’s health in response to treatment or disease progression. By designing and promoting the open data architecture needed to bring about its broader availability and adoption, Estrin is addressing many challenges to, and opportunities for, socially important applications of mobile health.

	About Deborah's Work

	Deborah Jin is a physicist who uses recent advances in atomic cooling to study the behavior of atoms near absolute zero. As a postdoctoral fellow, Jin participated in early demonstrations of Bose-Einstein condensation—a process in which a small number of atoms become so cold that they collapse into a single quantum state, effectively becoming a giant atom. More recently, Jin has led efforts to apply laser cooling and magnetic trapping techniques to explore the properties of super-cooled fermions, which cannot form Bose-Einstein condensates due to quantum mechanical constraints; attempting to force fermions to a minimal temperature results in a set of atoms in a stack of quantized energy states. Jin made early and critical advances toward reliable experimental production of this minimum temperature state—the degenerate fermi gas. This protocol has importance beyond experimental novelty; in theory, fermions at the higher energy states of a degenerate gas should form Cooper pairs, as electrons do in superconductive materials. The phenomenon has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory, but doing so will represent an important advance in condensed matter physics. Through a combination of strong theoretical background and remarkable experimental innovation, Jin has provided the field the first giant step towards reaching this milestone.

	About Derek's Work

	Derek Peterson is a historian reshaping our understanding of the African experience of colonialism through close study of local texts and the creativity of their authors. Fluent in Gikuyu and Swahili, important languages in eastern Africa, Peterson draws on an unprecedented range of vernacular and English-language sources written by Africans, including record books, diaries, religious pamphlets, syllabi and dictionaries, oral histories, and letters. His analyses of these texts extend beyond their content to include the context in which they were created and their intellectual, aesthetic, and material characteristics.

	In his first book, Creative Writing: Translation, Bookkeeping, and the Work of Imagination in Colonial Kenya (2004), Peterson focuses on debates among literate Gikuyu about how to read, translate, and interpret colonial texts in accordance with their own aspirations and perspectives. He examines, for example, how Gikuyu communities were able to exert influence in mission schools by shaping syllabi, exams, and translations of religious and other educational materials. He also teases out how these debates often intersected with conversations around identity, politics, ethnicity, and nationalism. Peterson's second book, Ethnic Patriotism and the East African Revival (2012), shows how the emergence of nationalism and independence movements across East Africa was inextricably intertwined with Protestant revivalism. Through their public professions of faith and indifference to social conventions, Revivalists resisted both colonial rule and nationalists' attempts to create orderly, progressive communities based on ethnic consolidation and ancestral traditions.

	Central to Peterson's work as a historian of East Africa is his commitment to identifying and preserving historical documentation. After discovering several local archives in dire conditions during his research, he spearheaded a long-term partnership with African scholars and universities that has resulted in the rescue of local, regional, and national archives, which are now accessible to other scholars. Peterson's wide-ranging scholarship and archive preservation efforts are challenging long-standing narratives about colonialism and nationalism in Africa and opening new avenues for further research.

	About Diane's Work

	Diane Meier is a geriatrician who is shaping the field of palliative care and making its benefits available to millions of Americans suffering from serious illness. While working as a geriatric physician at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, she recognized that modern medicine’s focus on curing disease and prolonging life failed to treat the physical and psychological distress of patients in both early and advanced stages of serious illness. Her studies found that a high percentage of seriously ill patients in hospitals were experiencing limited communication between patients and clinicians, poor management of pain, and insufficient support and social services for family caregivers. To fill these voids, Meier established the Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute at Mount Sinai, a model program that assists patients and families in navigating the complexities of illness and devises strategies for managing pain and other symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, and loss of appetite. While working as a clinician, she publishes widely on palliative care in major medical journals, develops guidelines and national quality standards for the field, and educates the general public through the media about this emerging area of medicine. Meier also directs the Center to Advance Palliative Care, an organization affiliated with Mount Sinai that provides technical guidance to hospital staff — physicians, nurses, social workers, and administrators — in creating, structuring, and financing new palliative care programs throughout the United States. As the aged population rapidly increases, Meier is addressing an urgent medical and social need and transforming treatment for the seriously ill into more humane and effective care.

	About Dianne's Work

	Dianne Newman is a microbiologist investigating the role that bacteria have played in shaping the Earth and continue to play in modern biomedical contexts. With training in environmental engineering, Earth science, geobiology, and molecular genetics, Newman brings together techniques and perspectives from numerous fields to study the evolution of ancient microbes’ metabolic processes (i.e., ways of obtaining needed energy and nutrients) and their effects on the geochemistry of their environments.

	One major line of inquiry focuses on how ancient bacteria thrived prior to the rise of readily accessible atmospheric oxygen. Informed by colleagues’ analyses of the chemical composition of ancient rock formations, Newman analyzes modern microorganisms that resemble ancestor organisms from the planet’s early history. Her studies have revealed how certain ancient bacteria respired (or “breathed”) arsenic and iron, using them for the electron-transfer reactions that are necessary for metabolism. Newman’s studies of the processes whereby bacteria utilize iron rather than water as a substrate for photosynthesis significantly advanced a hypothesis that this type of anoxygenic metabolism catalyzed the deposition of early banded iron formations. Newman and collaborators also determined that the presence of 2-methylhopanes, an organic biomarker, in ancient rocks is not a reliable indicator of cyanobacteria and the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis, as previously thought. Rather, the presence of these compounds is likely a marker of different organisms and environmental stresses, a finding that is providing clues into the types of niches where these compounds promote the survival of diverse bacteria.

	Newman is using the insights she has gained about ancient bacteria to understand how modern bacterial communities grow and survive in low-oxygen environments of contemporary biomedical significance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant pathogen that infects patients with cystic fibrosis, forms biofilms in the oxygen-limited conditions of mucus-filled lungs. Her work on how P. aeruginosa produces and utilizes electron-shuttling compounds called phenazines to facilitate survival within infected lungs could lead to more effective treatments for these and other chronic infections. Through her ability to bridge disparate disciplines and see the commonalities that underlie seemingly distinct processes, Newman is enriching our understanding of the impact of microorganisms from the early days of Earth’s history to human health today.

Dimitri Nakassis,2015-06-15,40,Male,Classicist,University of Toronto,"Toronto, Canada","Classics, Late Antiquity, and Medieval Studies","
                  
	About Dimitri's Work

	Dimitri Nakassis is a classicist transforming our understanding of prehistoric Greek societies. His rare intellectual breadth, comprising philology, archaeology, and contemporary social and economic theory, has equipped Nakassis to challenge the long-held view that Late Bronze Age Mycenaean palatial society (1400–1200 BC) was a highly centralized oligarchy, quite distinct from the democratic city-states of classical Greece.

	Instead, he proposes that power and resources were more broadly shared. This thesis, developed in his first book, Individuals and Society in Mycenaean Pylos (2013), is derived from a meticulous reinterpretation of Pylos’s administrative and accounting records (found on clay tablets and written in the early Greek script, Linear B). Standard interpretations of the tablets suppose a rigid political structure in which a small group of palace elites controlled and distributed all resources. Nakassis re-examined this model using a traditional method, prosopography, but through the lens of contemporary theoretical discussions of agency and structure. He determined that some recurrences of a personal name refer to the same individual playing multiple, sometimes competing, roles. This insight offers an alternative picture of the Mycenaean world as a more open society with a dynamic and competitive economic structure that displays some similarities to the democratic polis of classical Greece.

	Nakassis is testing his hypothesis through an archaeological survey, the Western Argolid Regional Project, that will reconstruct the settlement history of a core region of the Mycenaean world from prehistory to modern times and clarify how Mycenaean states mobilized labor, incorporated peripheral communities, and expressed power over many centuries. He is also co-directing a new study of the Linear B tablets from Pylos that includes the use of digital imaging technologies (three-dimensional scanning and Reflectance Transformation Imaging, a kind of computational photography) to produce high-quality print and digital editions of these important documents for the first time. Nakassis’s multifaceted approach to the study of Bronze Age Greece is redefining the methodologies and frameworks of the field, and his nuanced picture of political authority and modes of economic exchange in Mycenaean Greece is illuminating the prehistoric underpinnings of Western civilization.

	About Dina's Work

	Dina Katabi is a communications researcher working at the interface of computer science and electrical engineering to improve the speed, reliability, and security of data exchange. Katabi has contributed to a range of networking issues, from protocols to minimize congestion in high-bandwidth networks to algorithms for spectrum analysis, though most of her work centers on wireless data transmission.

	In WiFi (802.11) networks, it is common for two devices to send packets of information nearly simultaneously, resulting in partial data loss and rejection of both packets, a process that is repeated until each packet is transmitted without interference. Katabi and colleagues developed a “ZigZag” algorithm that reconstructs the contents of the collided packets by combining the usable fragments from each, thereby reducing the retransmission rates significantly. Additionally, while WiFi signals are typically thought of as communication signals, Katabi and her students have shown that they can be used to track the movements of humans, even if they are in a closed room or behind a wall. This technology can also be used to send commands to a computer via a person’s gestures as the signals reflect off of the person’s body.

	Because 802.11 networks are radio broadcasts, their signals are vulnerable to interception and manipulation by nefarious third parties. Katabi designed a method that uses random wireless signals to protect low-power devices during the exchange of encryption keys and make it impossible for intermediaries to insert themselves undetected (“man-in-the-middle” attack) in the data stream. For safety reasons, some wireless devices need to transmit unencrypted data—for example, pacemakers—which makes them sensitive to malevolent interference. She and her colleagues are designing wearable devices that protect pacemakers against unwanted manipulation while allowing medical personnel emergency access without security codes.

	Additional projects, such as showing the potential of radio interference to increase bandwidth and developing data protocols that address network congestion, demonstrate Katabi’s ability to translate long-recognized theoretical advances into practical solutions that could be deployed in the real world. Through her numerous contributions, Katabi has become a leader in accelerating our capacity to communicate high volumes of information securely without restricting mobility.

	About Dinaw's Work

	Dinaw Mengestu is a young writer whose novels and nonfiction pieces open a window into the little-explored world of the African diaspora in America. A native of Ethiopia who came to the United States with his family at the age of two, Mengestu composes tales distilled from the experience of immigrants whose memories are permanently seared by escape from violence in their homelands. His debut novel, The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears (2008), is a poignant chronicle of exile that eschews sentimentality by refusing to allow its narrator—a struggling Ethiopian refugee in a gentrifying neighborhood of Washington, DC—to find an easy form of solace or redemption. In this rich and multidimensional tale, Mengestu paints a powerful portrait of lives uprooted and remade in the wake of political violence as well as the fractures and tensions that characterize rapidly changing areas of contemporary urban America. He explores the transformation of the immigrant experience through the increasing flow of information and people between their adopted homes and their countries of origin in How to Read the Air (2010), which chronicles a young man’s efforts to comprehend and come to terms with his parents’ complicated past. In addition to his fiction writing, Mengestu is also a talented freelance journalist, recently making forays into war-torn regions of sub-Saharan Africa to write about life in Darfur, northern Uganda, and eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda. Mengestu’s depictions of the loss of culture, community, and landscape endured by immigrants in America are broadening the thematic concerns and voices encompassed by the American novel.

	About Dominique's Work 

	Dominique Morisseau is a playwright whose works portray the lives of individuals and communities grappling with economic and social changes, both current and historical. With a background as an actor and spoken-word poet, she uses lyrical dialogue to construct emotionally complex characters who exhibit humor, vulnerability, and fortitude as they cope with sometimes desperate circumstances.

	Her plays juxtapose beauty with destruction, hope with despair, and bring to light the complicated realities of urban African American communities. The Detroit Project, a trilogy of works inspired by August Wilson’s Century Cycle, paints an authentic picture of the city at three moments in time. Set during the riots of the summer of 1967, Detroit ’67 (2013) delves into the bond between a brother and sister and the difficult, life-altering decisions they must make against a backdrop of chaos and economic instability. Paradise Blue (2015) dramatizes the lives and music of the jazz community in a Detroit neighborhood in 1949, where legendary artists performed and flourished before urban renewal policies forever altered the landscape. The final play in the trilogy, Skeleton Crew (2016), is set in 2008 in an automotive stamping plant during the worst of the recession and centers on characters wrestling with conscience, identity, and the instinct for economic survival. Music features prominently throughout The Detroit Project, with Motown, jazz, and hip-hop tracks serving to accentuate a mood and underscore dialogue, while Morisseau captures the city’s distinctive rhythms of speech to further convey the specificity of place.

	Other works include Sunset Baby (2012), a raw, potent look at a daughter’s relationships with her estranged revolutionary father and her drug-dealing boyfriend, and Pipeline (2017), which explores a mother’s desperation and fatalism as she witnesses her black son’s seeming inability to avoid the “school to prison pipeline.”  Still early in her career, Morisseau is a powerful storyteller whose examination of character and circumstance is a call for audiences to consider the actions and responsibilities of society more broadly.

	About Donald's Work

	Donald Antrim is a writer whose tightly crafted works of fiction and nonfiction are marked by a contrast between elegant, concise language and the disorienting chaos in which his characters find themselves. Antrim creates fictional worlds that are both commonplace and yet surreal, combining close observations of the banality of everyday life with the absurd.

	The Verificationist (2000) recounts the ramblings of a group of psychoanalysts in an all-night restaurant through the eyes of Tom, who spends most of the book floating on the ceiling and whose tenuous grasp on reality is being destroyed by his dread of small, everyday decisions. In The Hundred Brothers (1998), Antrim creates a circumscribed, fantastical world in which a gathering of brothers at their ancestral estate (ostensibly to bury their father’s ashes) exposes the comical yet destructive manifestations of masculinity, sibling rivalry, and familial disintegration. As the night progresses and their task remains unfinished, the narrator both explicates and evokes in the reader the alternating feelings of love and hate that characterize his relationship with his brothers and lead to the novel’s inevitable, macabre climax.

	Antrim’s first foray into nonfiction, The Afterlife: A Memoir (2007), is a series of essays in which he attempts to make peace with the legacy of his mother’s alcoholism. In lucid, tightly controlled prose, he synthesizes the overwhelming emotional chaos of life with his mother and distills painful experiences into a work of tenderness and beauty, moving past the particularity of his ordeal toward a more universal struggle with mortality and melancholy. Currently completing a new novel as well as his first collection of short stories, Antrim continues to compose works of fiction that astonish and captivate.

	About Doris's Work 

	Doris Tsao is a neuroscientist who uses brain imaging technology, electrical recording techniques, and mathematical modeling. Though Tsao has explored several aspects of visual processing, such as the perception of depth and color, her most notable line of research has focused on uncovering the fundamental neural principles that underlie one of the brain’s most highly specialized and socially important tasks: recognizing a face.

	Prior neuroscientific research has identified regions in the inferior temporal cortex of monkeys that are particularly responsive to faces. These earlier studies, however, shed little light on how face-responsive cells within these regions might be organized and integrated into a system. Early in her career, Tsao confirmed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that the visual cortex of the macaque monkey shows face-selective activation in six small “patches” in each hemisphere of the brain. She then used data from fMRI brain scans as a map to guide the placement of single-neuron, electrical recording probes, which demonstrated that certain neurons display highly attuned sensitivity to faces, but not to other categories of objects, and that different patches across the brain’s cortex are integrated in a network dedicated to the visual processing of faces. Through other elegantly designed experiments, Tsao showed that the sensitivity of specific neurons can be further analyzed by measuring their responses to cartoon representations of faces with subtle variations in features and that certain features, such as facial shape and inter-eye distance, elicit particularly frequent and robust responses. 

	Her more recent findings, published in 2017, mark a significant advance in deciphering the code for facial identity in the macaque brain. For the study, Tsao recorded how a total of 205 neurons responded to specific dimensions of facial variability computed from photographs of human faces. After identifying which dimension each cell encoded, she was able to predict with remarkable accuracy how that neuron would respond to new faces. She ultimately succeeded in calculating and reconstructing a wide variety of facial configurations, based solely on the patterns of neural signals triggered by pictures of new faces shown to the macaque. By providing a systematic model for how the brain accomplishes a complex task essential for stable social interactions, Tsao’s experiments hold the potential to illuminate a range of other neural computation and sensory-processing functions.

	About Dylan's Work

	Dylan C. Penningroth is a historian who examines shifting concepts of property ownership and kinship in order to shed light on long-obscured aspects of African American life under slavery and in the half-century following slavery’s abolition. In his book The Claims of Kinfolk (2003), he elucidates the informal customs that slaves in the antebellum South used to recognize ownership of property, even while they were themselves considered by law to be property at the time. He also traces the interactions of these extra-legal, vernacular customs with the formal realm of law after emancipation by teasing stories of claims and disputes from such sources as the Freedman’s Bureau and Southern Claims Commission records compiled by the federal government after the Civil War. In addition to demonstrating that ownership of land, livestock, and other material possessions was much more widespread among slave communities than previously believed, Penningroth’s research draws out the underlying social relations and reliance on family members’ labor that made such ownership possible. To broaden the scope of his study, Penningroth extended his investigation across the Atlantic to Africa’s Gold Coast and found informative historical connections among societies that dealt with legacies of slavery and emancipation in the late nineteenth century. His current projects expand upon this transatlantic approach, exploring the importance of lineage and issues of inheritance for slave-descended people in early twentieth-century Ghana and mining Southern court records to uncover the experiences of African Americans who made use of local courts during the decades that followed emancipation. By compiling evidence from vast and widely scattered archives, Penningroth is painting a more vivid picture of relationships between parents and children, husbands and wives, and illuminating the ways communities of slaves and their descendents recognized what belonged to whom.

	Edet Belzberg is a documentary filmmaker whose films are distinguished by her choice of subjects, in-depth treatment of time and place, and elegant storytelling. In Belzberg’s signature film, Children Underground, she follows and films a group of homeless children living in a train station in Bucharest, Romania. Raw, graceful, and insightful, Children Underground personalizes the often dangerous and always chaotic and uncertain world of youngsters casually abandoned by their families and the larger society. Overcoming the obstacles of language, culture, and place, she records the individual and collective daily struggles of the five main characters with an unflinching, compassionate eye, managing at the same time to win the trust of children whose capacity for trust is all but depleted. Critically-acclaimed throughout the U.S. and Europe, the film has focused international attention on the social and institutional disregard of child welfare in post-communist Romania. Belzberg's characteristically intense and detailed treatment of the lives of children again defines her most recent and just completed film, Gymnast. While the film focuses on a completely different group of children in a totally different setting (the top three American girls preparing for the 2000 Olympics), Gymnast is a bold and original treatment of children under extreme conditions as it explores the motivations of individual stakeholders in the Olympic success of these teenagers. Future projects of this young filmmaker promise other enduring revelations into the lives of overlooked subjects and the realities of under-explored conditions.

	Edith Widder is a biologist and deep-sea explorer who combines expertise in oceanographic research and technological innovation with commitment to reversing the worldwide trend of marine ecosystem degradation. A specialist in bioluminescence (the light chemically produced by many ocean organisms), she has been a leader in helping to design and invent new submersible vehicles, instrumentation, and equipment to enable unobtrusive deep-sea observation of environments. Working with engineers, she has built a number of unique devices that enable scientists to see the ocean in new ways, including HIDEX, a bathyphotometer that measures how much bioluminescence there is in the oceans, and LoLAR, the most sensitive deep-sea light meter. Most recently, Widder helped to design a remotely operated camera system, known as Eye in the Sea (EITS), which, when deployed on the sea floor, automatically detects and measures the bioluminescence given off by nearby organisms. EITS has produced footage of rare sharks, jellyfish, and squid in their natural habitats. In 2005, Widder left her post at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution to establish and lead a new organization, the Ocean Research and Conservation Association (Ocean Recon). A key effort of Ocean Recon is the development of state-of-the-art sensors and technological systems for evaluating water quality and ecosystem health. While translating complex scientific issues into engineerable solutions, Edith Widder is fostering greater understanding of ocean life as a means to better, more informed ocean stewardship.

	About Edward's Work

	Edward P. Jones is a fiction writer who renders in story a mysterious incongruity of the human experience—how faith, dignity, and love often survive, and sometimes thrive, in the face of systemic adversity. His debut collection of fourteen short stories, Lost in the City (1992), deals with African American working class and underclass experiences in mid-twentieth-century, inner-city Washington, D.C. In a realistic and evocative style, Jones depicts characters that, despite the constant and unacknowledged despair of their existences, live rich, varied, and compelling lives. A multi-layered, historical novel, The Known World (2003), is Jones’s second major work. In this sprawling saga set in antebellum Virginia, Jones examines the world of free blacks who owned black slaves. Told from several different viewpoints in an intricate structure full of foreshadowing, he provides a broad view of the complex system of slavery, capturing the experience of those who suffered its deadening effects. Jones works painstakingly to compose artful, morally complicated fiction that challenges, provokes, and enriches.

	About Edwidge's Work

	Edwidge Danticat is a novelist whose moving and insightful depictions of Haiti’s complex history are enriching our understanding of the Haitian immigrant experience. In works that chronicle the lives of ordinary Haitians, she evokes themes of family, isolation, and community that, while grounded in a specific cultural milieu, resonate with a wide range of audiences. With graceful, deceptively simple prose, she recounts the 1937 massacre of Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic in The Farming of Bones (1999); told through the eyes of a young domestic servant, the story of the atrocity becomes one of cultural and spiritual survival. In The Dewbreaker (2004), a series of seemingly disconnected stories are revealed to revolve around the same traumatic events. Danticat challenges readers of these stories to understand and forgive a perpetrator of horrific atrocities committed in a distant time and place, illustrating how events in Haiti continue to haunt the immigrants of the diaspora. Her most recent book, a memoir entitled Brother, I’m Dying (2007), pays tribute to her father and uncle through an unflinching account of the triumphs and tragedies they experienced in Haiti and the United States. In these and other works, Danticat provides a nuanced portrait of the intersection between nation and diaspora, home and exile, and reminds us of the power of human resistance, renewal, and endurance against great obstacles.

	About Elissa's Work

	Elissa Hallem is a neuroscientist who explores the physiology and behavioral consequences of odor detection.  As a graduate student, she undertook expansive studies of olfaction in fruit flies that revealed several important, and sometimes unexpected, insights.  Starting with a mutant fly strain that lacks any odorant receptor in a well-characterized subset of olfactory receptor neurons, Hallem produced more than twenty different transgenic fruit fly lines, each expressing a single, known odorant receptor gene in these neurons.  She then measured in each strain the electrophysiologic response to a set of more than one hundred different odorants.  Among other findings, her analyses demonstrated that some odorant receptor types are highly selective and others are more broadly tuned, with an unexpectedly high fraction of odorant/receptor combinations inhibiting (rather than increasing) neuron firing rates; as a whole, these data contribute significantly to explaining and predicting the neural representation of odors.  As a postdoctoral fellow, she shifted her attention to the connection between chemoreception and behavior.  Using as a model system the nematode worm C. elegans (in which the distribution and connections of every neuron are well-characterized), she identified the molecular mechanism for carbon dioxide sensitivity and the neural circuits that mediate its avoidance behavior.  While free-living, adult nematodes may find carbon dioxide detection important for avoiding predators, some juvenile parasitic nematodes use carbon dioxide to locate host organisms to invade.  These parasites are endemic to human populations, particularly in tropical regions; they infect more than 20 percent of people across the globe.  Through her basic research, Hallem is applying her experience and expertise in invertebrate chemoreception to identify interventions, either pharmacologic or behavioral, that may eventually reduce the scourge of parasitic infections in humans.

	About Elizabeth's Work

	Elizabeth Anderson is a philosopher examining how evolving concepts of freedom and equality are experienced in our daily lives. She combines a high level of analytical rigor with a pragmatist methodology in her investigations of the ways various institutions, policies, and social practices structure relations among people and serve to promote or hinder conditions of democratic equality and human flourishing.

	In an extensive body of work, Anderson formulates principles based on empirical evidence about problems of practical importance and urgency—from the persistence of racial segregation to the authoritarian aspects of the modern workplace—instead of engaging in thought experiments or posing hypothetical questions about an ideal world. She has made pivotal contributions to a number of philosophical debates on such subjects as the ethical limitations of markets, the effects of gendered distributions of power on the production and reception of knowledge, and the concept of equality. As she articulates in her 1999 paper “What Is the Point of Equality?” Anderson understands equality to be fundamentally concerned with equal relations among people rather than the equal distribution of goods, such as income and wealth. She builds upon this landmark paper in her book The Imperative of Integration (2010), which incorporates decades of economic, sociological, and psychological research on the effects of racial segregation as a cause of status inequality between black and white Americans. In her lectures-turned-book Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (and Why We Don’t Talk About It) (2017), Anderson calls attention to the ways that many employers—from corporate firms and retail stores to processing plants and restaurants—exercise a far more sweeping scope of power and arbitrary authority over workers’ lives, speech, and privacy than is fully acknowledged in public discourse surrounding the liberating effects of a free market economy. Her argument offers a valuable lens through which to consider how workers might be given more of a voice in workplace governance, particularly for those at the lower levels of the labor market.

	Anderson is currently working on a history of egalitarianism, focusing on the history of the abolitionist movement in Britain as a central case study to demonstrate how the collective updating of normative beliefs can lead to progressive change and the broad transformation of moral consciousness. By applying a pragmatist’s approach to critical issues facing American society and the world at large, Anderson is demonstrating how philosophy conducted in close engagement with social science and historical research can offer profound, practical insights into how we might live together more justly.

	Since launching her independent career in 1979, Streb has developed an original approach to choreography that is action oriented and gravity defying in movement.  For inspiration, she has drawn from Russian Constructivist and Bauhaus dance movements, as well as from boxing, the circus, the rodeo, and gymnastics.  She has stretched the language and structure of dance, formulating a vocabulary that is at once athletic and aesthetic.  In many performances, the only ""music"" she allows is the natural or amplified sound of bodily impact, reinforcing the primacy of physical action in her work.  Streb seeks to expose the inherent tension between gravity and volition within structures that are at once confining and liberating, and she succeeds in revealing and projecting an exhilarating physicality, often with ahumorous touch.

	About Elizabeth's Work

	Elizabeth Turk is a sculptor who transforms her signature medium of marble into strikingly intricate, seemingly weightless objects that defy expectations of a traditionally monumental, heavy, and prone-to-fracture material. While her past artistic projects have involved works in metal, glass, and porcelain, as well as drawings, photography, and video, Turk has focused on marble in her major series of works. Inspired by the challenges the hard stone poses for an artist interested in rendering nature’s most delicate forms, she has achieved an extremely fine level of detail in an often-unforgiving substance. Employing a variety of electric grinders, files, and small dental tools with a dexterous touch, her technical virtuosity is on full display in “The Collars,” a series of sixteen painstakingly carved sculptures that explore a rich variety of organic and geometric patterns. The elaborate collars in this collection combine allusions to decorative motifs and the self-organizing systems of the natural world, drawing from lace-making and Elizabethan fashion as well as botanical, skeletal, and architectural structures. Continuing the theme of fragile, textile-like compositions with the strength and heft of stone, Turk creates a surprising sense of buoyancy and undulating movement in her recent series of marble ribbons suspended in midair. With these and other visually arresting feats of precision, Turk is pushing the physical limits of her material and reviving a classical medium for contemporary artistic exploration.

Ellen Bryant Voigt,2015-06-15,72,Female,None Provided,None Provided,"Cabot, Vermont",Poetry,"
                  
	About Ellen's Work

	Ellen Bryant Voigt is a poet whose eight published collections meditate on will and fate and the life cycles of the natural world while exploring the expressive potential of both lyric and narrative elements. Her upbringing on a farm in Virginia and her training as a pianist inform much of her writing, which is notable for its distinctive musical quality. Through her mastery of line and rhythm, she celebrates the grandeur of the poetic form, while her imagery remains rooted in scenes of rural life and close observations of natural phenomena.

	Voigt’s earliest books, Claiming Kin (1976) and Forces of Plenty (1983), share an intimate, personal focus and use short-lined stanzas reminiscent of folk ballads and metrical psalms. In Kyrie (1995), she widens her lens to address the influenza pandemic of 1918–19—a historical tragedy with international impact—in a book-length sequence of sonnets spoken by imagined survivors. Voigt’s most recent collection, Headwaters (2013), marks a significant transition in style from her many preceding volumes; she abandons all punctuation and regularity of line length and imbues her verse with a sense of urgency through propulsive phrasing and rapid shifts in tone. Poems titled simply “Owl,” “Cow,” and “Fox” capture a mind in motion, fiercely examining both the instinctive behaviors of animals and our own human dilemmas and attachments.

	In addition to her writing, Voigt is a dedicated and influential teacher. In 1976 she created the first low-residency M.F.A. program for writers (originally based at Goddard College and moved to Warren Wilson College in 1981), making rigorous mentorship available to students without relocation to campuses far from their homes. She has also authored two books on the writer’s craft: The Flexible Lyric (1999) and The Art of Syntax: Rhythm of Thought, Rhythm of Song (2009). A poet of sustained excellence and emotional depth, Voigt continues to advance American literary culture through her ongoing experimentation with form and technique.

	About Elodie's Work

	Elodie Ghedin is a biomedical researcher who is harnessing the power of genomic sequencing techniques to generate critical insights about human pathogens. Although the technology for obtaining nucleotide sequence data continues to accelerate, the labor-intensive task of analyzing and annotating the resulting data — for example, identifying genes, their functions, and their expression; determining the arrangement of genes within the genome; performing phylogenetic and functional comparisons with other known species — often lags behind. Ghedin has established herself as a leader of international projects that coordinate the efforts of scores of scientists to decode the function of some of the most virulent human pathogens. A major focus of her work has been parasites that cause diseases endemic to tropical climates, such as leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, elephantiasis, and river blindness. Through her direct research and mobilization of global scientific collaborations, Ghedin's work illuminates the similarities and differences in the molecular physiology of the various parasites, with important implications for targets for drug development. In addition, Ghedin and her colleagues are applying similar approaches to understanding viruses that infect humans. RNA viruses such as HIV and influenzae mutate particularly rapidly, making vaccine development difficult. In a high-resolution study of complete genome sequences of influenza A from thousands of isolates collected in the New York area, Ghedin and colleagues showed that the virus evolves with surprising rapidity even in a circumscribed geographic region. Through her contributions to parasitology and virology, Ghedin demonstrates that molecular genetics is not only essential for exploring the basic biology of pathogens but also represents a powerful tool in the hands of scientists working in coordination to improve public health across the globe.

Trained at Oxford in philosophy, at Yale in jurisprudence, and currently a Ph.D. candidate in psychoanalysis, Saks is recognized by the mental health profession and by legal scholars alike as an important contributor to national debates on mental health policy. She has played a major role in contemporary discussions of mental health law, patients’ rights, and multiple-personality disorder, including such issues as involuntary commitment, competency to be executed, proxy consent, and the right to refuse treatment. Her contributions and commitment to mental health law took on a personal dimension with the publication of her 2007 memoir, The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness. In this memoir, Saks made public for the first time her lifelong struggle with schizophrenia, including severe episodes of psychosis as well as experiences with misguided or harmful treatments. Remarkably, she has been able to overcome this usually debilitating illness, bringing to her work both expert and firsthand perspectives. Though Saks achieved professional acclaim as a legal scholar before most friends and colleagues knew of her own battle with mental illness, the publication of her memoir has provided additional gravity to her contribution to scholarship, practice, and policy. Currently, Saks is leading a study with a multidisciplinary team of colleagues to understand better high-functioning schizophrenics, a largely unexamined area. Her personal biography will give this study an uncommon depth and richness and further extend her impact on mental health law and disability rights policy.

	About Emily's Work

	Emily Thompson is an interdisciplinary scholar whose work focuses on the often-overlooked subject of sound and fills an important gap in contemporary American history, reaching into domains as diverse as urban design and cinema studies. In her book, The Soundscape of Modernity, she integrates the histories of the United States, technology, science, sound production, and acoustics to examine the transformation of the American soundscape from the turn of the century to the opening of Radio City Music Hall in 1933. Thompson organizes her work around developments in twentieth-century architecture, such as new concert halls and new building materials, and explores innovations in the science of acoustics, the emergence of excessive noise, and the efforts of scientists and designers to create new spaces and a new, “modern” sound. Her interests center around changes in acoustic design as reflections of larger cultural and social shifts in American life in the early 1900’s; she documents the interplay between differences in acoustic characteristics of buildings constructed during this period and increases in the value placed at the time on technological mastery, efficiency and control in modern life. Thompson’s most recent project, on the role of engineers, projectionists, and other industry technicians in the transition to synchronized sound in cinema, promises to provide a similarly penetrating analysis of another important moment in the history of sound and technology. By charting the transformation of the elusive and ephemeral phenomenon of sound, Thompson has recovered an important history of our time.

	About Emily's Work

	Emily Wilson is a classicist and literary scholar demonstrating the vital role translation plays as a creative form of mediation across linguistic borders and between antiquity and the present day. Trained in both classics and comparative literature, she combines a thorough knowledge of classical sources with philological acumen and finely honed stylistic skills. These attributes have enabled her to produce rigorously researched works of scholarship and translation that are illuminating and engaging for specialist and non-specialist readers alike.

	In her spare and sonorous rendering of the Homeric epic, The Odyssey (2017), one of the oldest and most revered poems in the Western tradition, Wilson employs an unornamented, modern idiom in her translation of each Homeric line. She reconfigures the original Greek dactylic hexameter into the regular metrical form of iambic pentameter, which is the most common meter in English poetry. In so doing, Wilson succeeds in conveying to contemporary readers one of the ancient text’s signature characteristics—its metrical, musical regularity, inherited from archaic oral traditions—while also echoing its swift, varied, and dramatic pacing. Her rendering is also attuned to the complex representation of female agency within the epic poem and to the dangers of importing misogynistic modern concepts into passages where the original text used more neutral terms. Similarly, she calls attention to ways that prior translations have smoothed over harsh social realities, such as the existence of slavery in archaic Greece, by using euphemistic terms such as “handmaidens” or “servants” to refer to enslaved women and men in Odysseus’s household. In her introduction to The Odyssey and in her essays and social media posts about the project, she highlights the unexamined assumptions that underlie past translators’ linguistic choices and deftly articulates the ways in which all translation decisions are implicated in a web of assumptions about social relations, both ancient and modern.

	Wilson’s earlier scholarship similarly explores continuities across human experience, as well as the discontinuities of historical difference. Her first book, Mocked with Death: Tragic Overliving from Sophocles to Milton (2004), examines texts from classical Greece, imperial Rome, and seventeenth-century England, while her numerous other works have included translations of tragedies by Seneca and Euripides, a biography of Seneca, and a book on the philosophical and literary afterlife of the death of Socrates, an event that has exerted an enduring influence on the Western imagination. Currently at work on a translation of The Iliad, Wilson is animating classical literature for new audiences and revealing connections between the social, political, and ethical issues they explore and those our current era faces.

	Biography

	Emily Wilson received a BA (1994) and MPhil (1996) from the University of Oxford and a PhD (2001) from Yale University. She is currently a professor in the Department of Classical Studies and the Department of Comparative Literature and Literary Theory at the University of Pennsylvania. Wilson’s additional works include translations of Six Tragedies (2010) by Seneca and four tragedies of Euripides (Bacchae, Helen, Electra, and Trojan Women) published in The Greek Plays (2016). Her other books include The Greatest Empire: A Life of Seneca (2014) and The Death of Socrates: Hero, Villain, Chatterbox, Saint (2007).

	Quotes from Emily

	I study and translate ancient literature with awareness of its music, its humanity, its complexity, its diversity, and its unimaginable difference from the worlds of today. I search for the surprising points of connection that become visible when we read old stories with fresh eyes and ask new questions of those long-dead. I am passionate about stories, the power of words and the importance of using clear language to tell complicated truths about the very distant past in relation to the present. Ancient Greek and Roman literature is not the special property or legacy of any modern group of people; it belongs to none of us, and to us all. I want to open up the fields of classics, poetry, history, literature and translation to engage more diverse groups of people in the endlessly fascinating, endlessly difficult endeavor of swimming through language and through time.

	About Emmanuel's Work

	Emmanuel Candès is a mathematician and statistician known for developing a unified framework for addressing a range of problems in engineering and computer science, most notably compressed sensing. Compressed sensing is a technique for efficiently reconstructing or acquiring signals that make up sounds and images. Candès's research focuses on reconstructing high-resolution images from small numbers of random measurements, as well as recovering the missing entries in massive data tables.

	Using an approach that draws on concepts from linear algebra and L1 minimization (a concept of high-dimensional geometry), Candès and colleagues were able to reconstruct high-resolution signals from sparse measurements under specified conditions. In diagnostic healthcare, for example, reducing the number of measurements needed to create high-resolution MRI scans shortens the amount of time patients must remain still in the scanner, an outcome with particularly beneficial implications for children. The ability to process and/or reconstruct audio, visual, and wireless signals from limited data has also led to significant refinements in digital photography, radar imaging, and wireless communications. Candès has expanded this work to address problems in low-rank matrix completion, devising statistical estimation methods for inferring missing entries in data arrays. (This is analogous to trying to identify a customer's movie preferences from the partial movie ratings that the user has provided.) His framework holds promise for phase retrieval, a problem arising in many applications such as crystallography, diffraction imaging (X-ray), and astronomical instrumentation.

	Candès's work at the interface of applied and theoretical mathematics is generating new lines of research in information theory as well as laying the groundwork for improvements in many devices that make use of signal and image processing methods.

	SWF’s multipronged strategy is grounded in the transformation of abandoned buildings and vacant lots into sites of sustainable urban agriculture, which also serve as platforms for project-based educational and mentorship programs, intergenerational collaboration, and the creative reuse of salvaged materials through innovations in design. In 2011, Pratt transformed a former shoe warehouse into a vibrant center for aquaponics, a system for cultivating fish and plants that recycles ammonia-rich waste from the fish into nutrients for the plants, which, in turn, purify the water for recirculation. In addition to producing large quantities of locally grown food, the facility also functions as a dynamic classroom and design laboratory, providing valuable hands-on learning experiences for students of Chicago State University and Chicago Public Schools, among numerous other groups. The theme of regenerative nutrients flowing through and sustaining natural ecosystems and entire communities runs throughout SWF’s current programs. SWF expanded its operations in 2014 to build a thriving community farm—the Perry Avenue Commons—in the Washington Park and Englewood neighborhoods on the site of a former correctional school for boys. Spread across four contiguous city blocks, the Commons currently comprises several acres of gardens, a formerly foreclosed home since renovated and converted into a “Think-Do House” for cooking demonstrations and design workshops, solar-powered art galleries and greenhouses made from shipping containers, and a “Thought Barn” that was collectively raised in 2017 to serve as a multipurpose performance and gathering space. Career training and apprenticeships for youth and unemployed community members are an integral component of SWF’s farming and carpentry operations. Installations of the apprentices’ design-build projects have been exhibited in galleries and museums across the city as a way to connect the work of the Commons to broader audiences.

	Pratt’s holistic approach to community development—integrating agriculture, education, and design—is informing the work of organizations in other cities and demonstrating the power of using ecological systems as a guide for turning neglected urban neighborhoods into places of growth and vitality.

	About Emmanuel's Work

	Emmanuel Saez is an economist whose quantitative analyses, behavioral experiments, and theoretical insights are enhancing our understanding of the relationship between income and tax policy and reinvigorating the field of public economics. He and colleagues worldwide have designed high-resolution methods for measuring changes in income patterns through time and determining how taxation affects income and savings. For example, his landmark historical analyses of U.S. income distribution revealed the concentration of income among the highest earners to have a U-shaped pattern, shifting from a high fraction of total income before the Great Depression to a trough after World War II, and progressively increasing again beginning in the 1960s. The recent resurgence of income concentration among the highest earners is largely due to increased wage compensation (e.g., salaries, bonuses) rather than capital income (e.g., dividends, interest, rents). In a different study tracking filing patterns of unidentified individuals over time, Saez provided a more complete picture of how taxpayers at various income levels respond to changes in the income tax system, a key parameter for discerning the effectiveness of tax policy. Among his theoretical results, he has shown that, for low-wage workers, the net economic benefits of earned income tax credits more than offset temporary displacements generated by moderate statutory floors on hourly wages. In a pioneering experimental collaboration with a commercial tax preparation firm (H&R Block) and other researchers, Saez demonstrated that people at moderate income levels contribute more often to retirement savings plans if participation incentives are presented to appeal to their perceived needs and aspirations, compared with financially equivalent (but less comprehensible) existing government incentives. Through his empirical and theoretical investigations, Saez is establishing a strong foundation for developing tax policies and practices that augment both equity and economic efficiency.

	About Eric's Work

	Eric Coleman is a leader in geriatric and chronic disease care whose work focuses on a problem in American health care that has been largely ignored: the miscommunications and errors that occur as patients transition from hospitals to post-discharge homes, sub-acute care facilities, or other sites of care. Working closely with patients and families, health care providers, and policymakers, Coleman is addressing system-wide deficiencies that too often result in subsequent poor patient outcomes. Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable during these displacements; an estimated 20 percent of Medicare patients discharged to their homes from hospitals are readmitted within thirty days, and the majority of these costly readmissions are preventable. Through rigorous empirical studies and insights gleaned from extensive interviews with patients and their families, Coleman has quantified the scope of the problem and devised predictive metrics and improvements for coordinated and seamless transfers of care. His Care Transitions Intervention, led by nurses and social workers trained as Care Transitions Coaches, equips patients and caregivers with critical knowledge and skills to enable self-care, including a complete personal health record with associated physician information; a reconciled list of medications; a timeline for follow-up appointments; and a list of red flags, or signs that the patient’s condition is deteriorating. Coleman has documented the success of this model, in terms of both patient satisfaction and reductions in hospital readmissions, through the Care Transitions Measure; as a result, his innovative prescriptions have been adopted nationally and internationally, most notably as essential elements in Medicare’s Community-Based Care Transitions Program, a new national initiative. Bringing these and related interventions to even greater scale here and abroad has the potential to improve substantially the care and health outcomes of millions of older adults suffering from chronic illness, saving many lives and much money.

	About Eric's Work 

	Eric Charnov is an evolutionary biologist who blends population genetics with economics to understand how organisms work.

	Charnov is perhaps best known for pathbreaking research in the 1970’s on foraging decisions, the evolution of sex ratio, sex reversal and hermaphroditism, and the structure of life histories.  He originated the sex allocation approach to plant breeding systems, and derived the “marginal value rule” for foraging in a patchy environment.  His current research uses ideas about symmetry, invariance, and scaling laws to understand various regularities in population biology.  In collaboration with K. Hawkes, he has applied some of these rules to human life histories, particularly to understand the riddle of menopause.  He is author or co-author of The Theory of Sex Allocation (1982), Infant-Mother Attachment (1985), and Life History Invariants: Some Explorations of Symmetry in Evolutionary Ecology (1993).

	About Erik's Work

	Erik Demaine is a young computer scientist who has already established a reputation for tackling and solving difficult problems. Although he actively pursues projects related to many areas of computer science, such as parallel processing architectures and algorithm complexity, Demaine is noted for his research in computational geometry. Recently, he collaborated on a proof of a long-standing conjecture known as the “carpenter’s rule,” which asserts that all closed polygons with non-crossing connections can be made convex (i.e., straightened out, roughly) without breaking or changing the relative length of the connections. This work reflects his broader interest in problems related to folding and bending. Such problems hold implications for both abstract mathematics and practical issues such as manufacturing methods. Demaine moves readily between the theoretical and the playful, with a keen eye to revealing the former in the latter. For example, he recently demonstrated that a popular computer game, Tetris, represents an example of a computational geometry problem that falls into the “NP-complete” category, implying explosive growth in difficulty with no shortcuts available. Demaine has also invented problems and solutions related to other areas of recreational mathematics (e.g., origami, combinatorial games). Through his eclectic choices for research topics and his prodigious and prolific output, Demaine has demonstrated an appetite for challenges that cross disciplinary boundaries and a capacity to synthesize ideas from disparate approaches.

	About Erik's Work

	Erik Mueggler is an anthropologist who explores Chinese communities, enriching our understanding of ethnic minorities in China's vast political, social, and cultural landscape. At the simplest level, he examines how repercussions of the Cultural Revolution continue to be seen in the daily lives of ordinary people in the provinces of southwestern China. Mueggler's vivid ethnographies query the effect of state-inflicted abuse and institutional authority on modern ritual, identity, and nationalism. In his book, The Age of Wild Ghosts, Mueggler draws on ritual, folklore, and memory to frame his analyses of community and justice in the township of Zhizuo. This work crosses the methodological boundaries of history and anthropology, bringing together such topics as the history of memory, culture and politics, poetry and material life, and production and reproduction. The effect is to produce new and persuasive conclusions about the distinctive relationship between China’s minorities and the State, offering a model for future ethnography in China and elsewhere. Still early in his career, Mueggler has set a benchmark for original and imaginative ethnography in provincial China.

	Esther Duflo is a development economist exploring the social and economic forces perpetuating the cycle of poverty for the poorest peoples in South Asia and Africa. Combining innovative field experiments with rigorous empirical analysis, she identifies linkages and causal relationships between policy, poverty, behavior, and socioeconomic status. Much of Duflo’s work focuses on investigating the often disparate impact of economic interventions and social policies on women and children in developing nations. In one study, she measured the effect of monetary transfers to poor households for child health and found that pension transfers to grandmothers, rather than grandfathers, brought about the greatest improvement in the health of girls. Most recently, Duflo partnered with environmental economists to examine the long-term health effects on women and children of indoor pollution from traditional, solid-fuel cooking stoves. Through MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, which she co-founded, she has adapted randomized trial experiments, used extensively in the drug industry and experimental science, as a means of bringing increased rigor to the assessment of the costs and benefits of economic development interventions. Duflo also was among the founders of the Bureau for Research in Economic Analysis and Development (BREAD), a forum that facilitates the exchange of ideas among researchers working on development issues. Through these and many other projects, Duflo is enhancing international economic development policy and programs designed to improve the lives of impoverished populations around the world.

	Eva Silverstein is a theoretical physicist who questions fundamental assumptions of physics theory.

	In collaboration with Shamut Kachru, Silverstein is linking recent theories of particle physics and cosmology. She explores the relationship between the cosmological constant (a concept that originated with Einstein's general theory of relativity) and more recent explanations of particle physics based on string theory. These studies provide key insights into the age, structure, dynamics, and eventual fate of the universe. Quantum theory requires any vacuum to be filled with particles and antiparticles, continually created and annihilated. Getting the equations to add up properly requires quantum field theorists to postulate a host of, as yet, unobserved particles subsumed under a theory known as “supersymmetry.” Against this body of research, Silverstein and Kachru have employed orbifold theory to show how string theory can potentially explain vacua without resorting to postulating a zoo of supersymmetric particles that, if the program is successful, would greatly reduce the conflict between the cosmological constant and particle physics.

	About Eve's Work

	Eve Troutt Powell is a historian whose analysis of nineteenth-century Egypt sheds new light on the complicated dynamics between colonial powers and colonized peoples. In her recent book, A Different Shade of Colonialism: Egypt, Great Britain, and the Mastery of the Sudan, Troutt Powell traces the development of Egyptian nationalist identity during the time of British colonial rule over both Egypt and Sudan. Drawing from a breadth of materials ranging from literary texts, newspapers, and travelogues to more colloquial sources (e.g., cartoons, plays, popular songs), Troutt Powell identifies a distinctly imperialist tone audible in Egyptian nationalist rhetoric. Her study underscores the ways in which Egyptian nationalists projected an image of Sudan as a fellow member of one Nile Valley community, while promoting the incorporation of Sudan’s land, and while Sudanese slaves and servants were still fixtures in many wealthy Egyptian homes. Troutt Powell also points to the ways that the intellectual and political elite distinguished themselves as racially and ethnically superior to the Sudanese, in much the same way that the British colonials distanced themselves from their Egyptian subjects. Thus, Troutt Powell introduces racial stereotyping and slave-holding, topics often overlooked in studies of the Middle East, as practices that played an integral role in the formation of nineteenth-century Egyptian self-image. In so doing, Troutt Powell presents a complex picture of a “colonized colonizer,” one that inspires nuanced interpretations of race-relations and the impact of colonial rule throughout the Middle East, Africa, and beyond.

	About Fazal's Work

	Fazal Sheikh is a documentary photographer who uses the personalizing power of portraiture to bring the faces of the world’s displaced people into focus. His subjects have included Sudanese and Somali refugees at camps in Kenya, survivors of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the indigenous people of Pantanal, Brazil, and immigrants crossing, then recrossing, the border between Mexico and the United States. In contrast to sensational, mass-media depictions of humanitarian crises, he takes formal portraits of his subjects – living among them and earning their collaboration. With names printed prominently next to their images, mothers, children, wounded soldiers, and tribal elders assume stately poses, hold pictures of loved ones, and gaze directly at Sheikh’s camera, producing understated studies of human dignity under devastating circumstances. Relying on the clarity of black-and-white, naturally lit images, he presents these striking photographs with accompanying texts that describe, in the words of his subjects, the personal histories and circumstances leading to the conditions he records. In addition to completing four books of photography and participating in numerous exhibitions, Sheikh disseminates his work on DVD and via free website to reach the widest international audience possible. With his solemn and arresting works of art, Sheikh slows the act of viewing, calls attention to the persistent nature of conflict, and highlights the importance of bearing witness.

	Biography

	Fazal Sheikh received a B.A. (1987) from Princeton University. Through a photography project he undertook in Kenya as part of a 1992 Fulbright Fellowship in the Arts, Sheikh began his commitment to documenting the lives of refugees. He is the author of four published volumes, A Sense of Common Ground (1996), The Victor Weeps (1998), A Camel for the Son (2001), Ramadan Moon (2001), and Moksha (2005); the latter three books are part of a continuing series on international human rights. His work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions at such venues as the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Seattle Art Museum, and the International Center of Photography, New York.

	About Francisco's Work

	Francisco Núñez, a conductor, composer, pianist, and founder of the Young People's Chorus of New York City (YPC), is shaping the future of choral singing for children. His vision of young voices from inner-city to elite schools singing new music of the highest quality underpins all that he does. Melding this vision with expertise, passion, and entrepreneurship, Núñez has elevated the youth chorus to the ranks of serious contemporary music, commissioning and performing some of the most challenging works for youth choirs. His belief in the beauty of young voices and his commitment to experimenting with their boundaries and possibilities has allowed him to dramatically expand the expressive capabilities of the youth choir. Today, with over one thousand young people in five after-school choruses and thirteen choruses in its Satellite School Program in inner-city public schools, Núñez's YPC exposes young singers to an unmatched variety of music and music makers. YPC now tours throughout the United States and internationally, presents concerts to focus the attention of today's composers on the important instrument that is a child's voice, and engages in partnerships with dance companies, performing ensembles, radio stations, jazz artists, and leading American music publishers. YPC is the first children's choir in this country to be an official radio choir, heard regularly in New York City, and has commissioned more than fifty pieces of music from today's most respected contemporary composers through its Transient Glory series of concerts, CDs, and publications. Núñez has signaled broadly not only that youth choirs have the capacity to transform lives but that they can also expand artistic boundaries and hold a special place in musical achievement.

	Biography

	Francisco Núñez received a B.S. (1988) from New York University. He has served as founder and artistic director of the Young People's Chorus of New York City since its inception in 1988 as part of the Children's Aid Society of New York, where he held the position of director of music for nine years. YPC is currently the resident chorus at Lincoln Center's Frederick P. Rose Hall and at WNYC, New York Public Radio. Núñez also leads the University Glee Club of New York City and is active as a composer and as a guest conductor of orchestras, children's choirs, and festivals worldwide.

	About Frank's Work

	Frank Wilczek is a theoretical physicist.

	His work with David Gross at Princeton concerned the change of fundamental couplings with energy.  This work led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom and to the proposal and experimental verification of quantum chromodynamics.  Asymptotic freedom makes it possible to understand the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as occurred in the earliest moments of the big bang.  It also permits the construction of unified models of particle interactions, which have concrete predictive power.  Wilczek has been a leading participant in all of these developments.  A notable result of the cosmological work is a compelling explanation of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the present universe.  A concept he discovered and developed, that of fractional quantum statistics or anyons, has been found to characterize the behavior of new states of matter, and is the focal point of much activity in condensed matter physics.  Some of his recent work has clarified fundamental issues in the quantum theory of black holes.

	About Gabriel's Work

	Gabriel Victora is an immunologist investigating acquired, or adaptive, immunity and clarifying the mechanisms by which organisms' responses to infection are improved. Victora has reconfigured and refined a number of molecular and cellular imaging methods in order to visualize, in real time, affinity maturation—the process through which adaptive immunity develops.

	When vertebrates are exposed to a pathogen, antibodies are activated with an affinity for specific antigens represented by proteins on the surface of the infecting pathogen. Over time, this antibody-based response is fine-tuned through affinity maturation, which occurs in lymph nodes and other related immune organs, and is driven by the iterative cycling of antibody-generating B cells. When antibodies are activated, their corresponding B cells rapidly proliferate and genetically diversify in one region of the lymph nodes before migrating to another area, where those with the highest affinity for the antigen are selected in the presence of antigen-presenting helper T cells. Through analysis of the proliferation, migration, and selection of B cells within the germinal centers of the lymphoid tissues, Victora has provided the most definitive evidence to date that affinity maturation of antibodies occurs in a manner akin to Darwinian evolution, as had been previously theorized but not demonstrated. Understanding the drivers of this selection process will advance understanding of the causes of immunodominance (why immune responses occur against only a few of the many antigenic features presented during infection) and original antigenic sin (the immune system's preferential use of antibodies from a previous infection even if they are less effective against a slightly different subsequent infection).

	Victora's research has practical implications for the development of new and more effective vaccines, whose protective immunity is based upon the workings of affinity maturation, and novel treatments for autoimmune disorders caused by aberrations in the germinal center reaction.

	Drawing on his training as a musician, a musicologist, and a historian, Tomlinson studies the interaction of musical thought and culture.  While maintaining a foundation in European traditions, his work has expanded outward to sketch a music history of global reach.  In his book Monteverdi and the End of the Renaissance (1986), he deals with the impact of literary forces on changing musical styles around 1600.  His book Music in Renaissance Magic: Toward a Historiography of Others (1992) brings poststructuralist historical approaches to bear on sixteenth-century musical magic.  In Metaphysical Song: An Essay on Opera (1999), he treats the connections of music drama to changing models of European subjectivity.  He is also the author of The Singing of the New World: Essays on the Powers of Amerindian Music, 1500-1700 (2005), which concerns New World song and theories of European colonialism.

	About Gary's Work

	Gary Cohen is a social entrepreneur and activist spurring environmental responsibility in health care both in the United States and abroad. In 1996, he co-founded Health Care Without Harm (HCWH), initially a grassroots cooperative, to bring attention to the fact that American hospitals had been major contributors to environmental pollution and had been largely ignoring the damage to local communities and environments caused by extensive use of harmful chemicals in medical devices, toxic cleaning agents, reliance on fossil fuels, and disposal of waste via incineration. Cohen has led a paradigm shift in the perceived responsibility of health care providers, from a narrow, patient-centered duty of service regarding individual health to a broader obligation to also “do no harm” to surrounding communities, their residents, and the global environment.

	At first, Cohen focused on one toxin or waste byproduct at a time. HCWH’s campaign against the use of mercury, a highly toxic neurotoxin once ubiquitous in thermometers and other medical devices, led to its virtual elimination in the United States and ultimately a global treaty phasing out its use by 2020. HCWH is also credited with playing a leading role in reducing the number of carcinogenic-emitting waste incinerators in the United States from 5,600 in the late 1990s to fewer than 70 in 2006. Since its founding, HCWH has grown to comprise thousands of hospitals and healthcare partners in more than 50 countries. In proposing practical, economically viable solutions, Cohen has achieved remarkable success in galvanizing a sense of social responsibility among hospitals and health care conglomerates and spearheading voluntary (rather than through legal or judicial mandates) adoption of safer practices.

	He has since expanded HCWH’s mission to engage environmental scientists, medical professionals, and institutional leadership around the broader challenges of sustainability, climate change, and community health. To that end, he has also founded or co-founded other organizations, including the Healthy Hospitals Initiative, a data-driven platform that guides hospitals in purchasing safer chemicals and healthy food and implementing energy efficient technologies, and Practice Greenhealth, a U.S.­-based membership organization for hospital systems to share best practices, information, and tools for environmentally responsible patient safety and care. In these ongoing strategic collaborations, Cohen is repositioning environmentally conscious health care as prudent, cost-effective, and easily within reach.

	Biography

	Gary Cohen received a B.A. (1978) from Clark University and studied at the University of California at Berkeley (1983–1984). He served as executive director of the National Toxics Campaign Fund (1989–1993) and co-founded the Military Toxics Project (1991–1994), before co-founding Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) in 1996. He currently serves as president of Health Care Without Harm and its membership affiliate, Practice Greenhealth.

	Gary Hill is an artist who has produced a large body of single-channel video works and mixed-media installations.

	Originally a sculptor, Hill began working with sound and video in the early 1970s. His use of text, speech, and image explores the physicality of language and issues of perception and viewer interactivity. For example, in his piece, Tall Ships (1992), the viewer enters the space in which the video images are projected. The boundary between viewer and image is blurred as the images of people approach and recede in ghostly cadence. The thresholds between language and image, silence and sound, and light and darkness are of primary concern in much of Hill’s work.

	About Gene's Work

	Gene Luen Yang is a graphic novelist and cartoonist whose work for young adults demonstrates the potential of comics to broaden our understanding of diverse cultures and people. Yang has produced full-length graphic novels, short stories, and serial comics, many of which explore present-day and historical events through a contemporary Chinese American lens.

	In American-Born Chinese (2006), Yang integrates tropes from American comics, Chinese folklore, and the Chinese immigrant experience. Three interlocking narratives contribute to a nuanced depiction of the struggles of adolescent Jin Wang as he comes to terms with his bicultural identity and attempts to assimilate in America. Yang employs elements of mythology and realism in his retelling of the legend of the Chinese folk hero the Monkey King, who offers a lesson on the need to accept oneself in order to thrive, and the character of Chin-Kee represents Jin Wang’s confrontation with the stereotypes of Chinese culture. In an ambitious two-volume work of historical fiction entitled Boxers and Saints (2011), Yang chronicles the peasant uprising against Western influences in China in 1900. The story of the Boxer Rebellion is told from two contrasting points of view: a boy who joins the rebels, and a girl taken in by Christian missionaries to whom she offers allegiance. Boxers and Saints is an immersive adventure tale, an educational primer on the Boxer Rebellion, and an illustration of how consideration of multiple perspectives enriches understanding of historical events.

	Having written much of his work while employed as a high school computer science teacher, Yang recognizes the instructional value of comics. He is currently writing a series of graphic novels, Secret Coders (2015­– ), that cleverly introduces computer coding within an engaging mystery plot. In these and other projects, such as the New Super-Man series, Yang is leading the way in bringing diverse characters to children’s and young adult literature and confirming comics’ place as an important creative and imaginative force within literature and art.

	Gene Luen Yang received a B.S. (1995) from the University of California at Berkeley and an M.A. (2003) from California State University at East Bay.

	About George's Work

	George Perle was a composer, a music theorist, and a musicologist.

	Perle, both as composer and theorist, radically reinterpreted the work of the Second Vienna School in his critique of Schoenberg’s twelve-tone method as the first step toward a new tonality, rather than a special technique of atonal composition.  His book, Serial Composition and Atonality (1962; 6th ed., 1991), was recognized as the standard work on Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.  The Operas of Alban Berg, in two volumes (1980, 1985), was a comprehensive overview of all of Berg’s compositions and of his life as well.  In Twelve-Tone Tonality (1977; 2d ed., 1996) and The Listening Composer (1990), Perle set forth his own musical language, and presented the view that the seemingly disparate styles of post-diatonic music share common structural elements, which collectively imply a new tonality.

	Biography

	Perle was a professor emeritus of music at the City University of New York.  His music is still widely performed by soloists and major orchestras in the U.S. and around the world.  He had numerous commissions resulting in significant pieces; his music also appeared on many recordings.

	About George's Work

	George Russell was a composer, a music theorist, an educator, and a conductor.

	Russell pioneered the investigation of contemporary modal harmony. His book, The Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization: The Art and Science of Tonal Gravity (1953; 4th ed., 2001), provided the theoretical foundations for the Lydian Concept, a theory of music that has influenced the work of many twentieth-century composers and improvisers. Using the Lydian Scale as the primary scale of Western music, the concept introduced the idea of chord/scale unity. It was the first theory to explore the vertical relationship between chords and scales, and was one of the only original theories to come from jazz. Russell’s first recorded composition was “Cubana Be/Cubana Bop,” written in 1947 for the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra.

	Russell released over twenty-five recordings of his compositions and performances, and toured Europe and Japan frequently with his Living Time Orchestra. A Distinguished Artist-in-Residence Emeritus at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, he was a guest conductor, a teacher, and a commissioned composer throughout Europe and the United States.

	About George's Work

	George Saunders is a short story writer whose mordantly hilarious tales retain, at their core, deep sympathy and compassion for the lives he depicts. Characterized by a blend of contrasting elements, much of Saunders’ fantastic and fanciful writings combine satire and surrealism with a naturalistic, colloquial use of language. With a keen eye for absurdity, a precise ear for vernacular dialogue, and a distinctively deadpan narrative voice, Saunders explores the poignant disappointments of his downtrodden characters and the slightly skewed, vaguely futuristic version of American society they inhabit. While his stories are humorous, the moral dilemmas faced by his fictional mothers, husbands, siblings, and neighbors underscore their humanity and lend gravity to his work. Exemplifying this approach, the title story of Saunders’ collection Pastoralia (2000) satirizes in a manner both comic and sobering the indignities of the workplace through its portrayal of two theme park employees’ daily struggles. Other books by Saunders include the story collections, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline (1996) and In Persuasion Nation (2006); a children’s book, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip (2000); and a novella, The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil (2005). This sharply observant, highly imaginative author continues to influence a generation of young writers and brings to contemporary American fiction a sense of humor, pathos, and literary style all his own.

	About Geraldine's Work

	Geraldine Seydoux is a scientist providing key insights into biology’s most complex processes: the creation of a fully formed adult animal from a single cell and the repetition of the process in the next generation. Development of specialized tissues depends on establishing an initial asymmetry in the embryo, but the precise control of this process in many species is unclear. Seydoux has demonstrated that, in the nematode, early asymmetry derives from the interaction of particular structures within the ovum and sperm at fertilization. In another line of research, she has demonstrated that proteins within the fertilizing sperm trigger reorganization of structural proteins within the ovum, a process that is the necessary first step for establishing anterior-posterior polarization of the single-celled embryo. Seydoux’s observations reveal an elaborate molecular dance by these proteins, leading to the formation of organs in the mature animal. Several lines of evidence suggest that the mechanisms she describes for nematode development are conserved in evolution throughout much of the animal kingdom.

	About Greg's Work

	Greg Asbed is a human rights strategist developing a new model—worker-driven social responsibility (WSR)—for improving conditions for low-wage workers within the twenty-first-century labor market. WSR is a bottom-up approach that ensures human rights are respected in the workplace; workers play a central role in establishing work condition standards and codes of conduct and have transparent channels for monitoring and enforcing those standards.

	WSR emerged from the decades-long work of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), an organization co-founded by Asbed, with Lucas Benitez and Laura Germino, in 1993 to redress injustices in the Florida tomato industry, including forced labor, sexual assault, and wage theft. Asbed was a principal architect of the coalition's Fair Food Program (FFP), a mechanism by which the purchasing power of consumers and large food companies is tapped to compel growers to improve farmworkers' working conditions. Growers agree to adhere to a code of conduct in the treatment of workers, and workers are educated (by other workers) about their rights and responsibilities. Purchasers have a zero-tolerance policy for abuses by their suppliers and also agree to pay a penny-per-pound premium that goes directly into growers' payrolls as a line-item bonus on workers' paychecks. Asbed helped devise the Fair Foods Standards Council, an independent monitoring organization, to ensure compliance through regular audits and complaint investigations. Since 2010, the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange and over a dozen purchasers, including Walmart, have signed on to the Fair Food Program. With the success of the FFP in the tomato industry, Asbed envisioned the potential for wider economic and social change, and together with colleagues, he designed the WSR framework.

	Workforces engaged with other crops in Florida, the garment industry in Bangladesh, and the dairy industry in Vermont have already or are in the process of adopting the WSR approach, and Asbed's expertise is being sought by international organizations for the development of customized variants of the WSR model to address such issues as child labor in Africa and gender-based violence in domestic work settings in Mexico. Asbed's visionary strategy for WSR has the potential to transform workplace environments across the global supply chain.

	About Gregg's Work 

	Gregg Gonsalves is an epidemiologist and global health advocate integrating his experiences as a community activist with quantitative analysis and operations research to improve responses to global public health challenges. For nearly three decades, Gonsalves was an HIV/AIDS activist, working with domestic and international organizations such as AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa. His efforts to connect the HIV/AIDS community with top-tier researchers and scientists were a critical catalyst to fundamental advances in scientific knowledge of the disease. These experiences deeply informed his later training in epidemiology and current efforts to optimize the effectiveness of health programs for epidemic diseases, particularly within poor and marginalized communities.

	Using a variety of quantitative approaches and operations research modeling, Gonsalves has determined how to identify hot spots for HIV testing in real time in order to maximize identification of undiagnosed HIV-positive persons; shed light on ways to minimize dropout of HIV-positive patients at key points in the care continuum; and assessed the epidemiological costs of emerging epidemics of HIV in the United States due to intravenous drug use and lack of needle exchange programs. In another line of research, Gonsalves examined the link between high rates of sexual violence against women living in informal settlements in Cape Town, South Africa, and the lack of indoor sanitation—the remote location of facilities left women vulnerable to attacks. He developed a mathematical model that determined the optimal number of new facilities and demonstrated that sanitation investments by the city would significantly reduce instances of sexual violence as well as their associated costs.

	Gonsalves co-founded the Global Health Justice Partnership (GHJP), an interdisciplinary initiative between the schools of law and public health at Yale University, to further advance human rights and social justice perspectives in public health and legal research, practice, and teaching. Working in cooperation with local nongovernmental organizations, GHJP mobilizes research and evidence around pressing health issues and translates that evidence into action. For example, GHJP and colleagues in South Africa documented the failure of mining companies and the South African government to compensate families for tuberculosis (TB) and silicosis acquired in the mines, and they continue to advocate for policy reform based on their comparative research. Currently, GHJP is working with organizations in Brazil to investigate the role of the war on drugs and high incarceration rates on the community burden of TB as well as advocacy for wider availability of hepatitis C treatment in U.S. prisons. Through these initiatives, Gonsalves is training a new generation of researchers who, like himself, work across public health and human rights sectors, scholarly research, and activism to correct disparities in global public health.

	About Gretchen's Work

	Gretchen Berland is a physician who uses her experience in documentary production and journalism to highlight issues that are critical to understanding and improving health care. Her video project, “Cross-Cover,” provides a first-person perspective on the problems faced by young doctors during their internship year; it chronicles the changes in their attitudes toward the patients they treat and in their personal and professional aspirations. Its frank portrayal of the internship process has been cited as a valuable tool for improving the quality of medical training. Berland’s more recent project, “Rolling,” uses the video diary format to document the experiences of several people who, for varying medical reasons, require wheelchairs for mobility. By placing the camera in the hands of her three subjects, she presents their struggles to maintain independence and dignity in the face of their disabilities from a compelling and informative vantage point. Berland also served as lead author on a survey of health information resources on the Internet. The study found that health care consumers, those with lower reading skills in particular, face significant obstacles to locating accurate, complete, and understandable information on a variety of common medical problems. Through her efforts, Berland prompts physicians and the public to consider several key questions about health and society: how we learn about our own health, how physicians teach and learn, and how affliction creates physical and social barriers that often pass unnoticed.

	About Guillermo's Work

	Guillermo Algaze is an anthropologist and archaeologist of the Near East whose research explores the formation of early cities and their first interactions. Mesopotamia of the fourth and third millennium B.C. saw the development of distinct Northern and Southern city-states that interacted through cultural and economic exchanges, and even colonization. Algaze’s ambitious reconstruction of this region’s political economy sparked a host of archeological studies evaluating new evidence in the context of his comprehensive model. Most recently, Algaze completed an excavation of the third millennium B.C. city of Titris in northern Mesopotamia. His research team has extended the application of magnetometry beyond its common use for locating landmarks within the city to develop a complete map of its boundaries and residential areas. Together with traditional excavations, with sites selected strategically from the magnetometry maps, Algaze has uncovered clear evidence of urban planning in ancient Mesopotamia. Algaze’s fieldwork and interpretations illuminate the social, cultural, and economic transformations taking place contemporaneously with the emergence of the earliest cities of the Near East.

	With virtually no formal education, Ong has developed an instinctive poetic sensibility that introduces audiences to an unusual new population of urban characters.  His plays are written with a simple structure of short scenes that at first seem to come from a profound detachment, fitting the “outsider” status of his characters.  Nevertheless, his distinctive style and strong characterizations form a compelling theatrical grammar that conveys the ironies of living in a multiracial society.  He is actively extending his work into performance work and fiction writing.  Among his stage works are an adaptation of WOYZECK (1992), Swoony Planet 1992), Widescreen Version of the World (1993), The Chang Fragments (1996), and Watcher (2001).  He is also the author of the novels Fixer Chao (2001) and The Disinherited (2004).

	Biography

	Ong is an independent playwright residing in New York City.  His plays have been presented at such theaters as the Public Theatre in New York and the Highways Performance Space in Los Angeles.

	Ong grew up in the Philippines and moved to Los Angeles when he was 16.  He dropped out of high school to work, educate himself, and begin writing.

	About Heather's Work

	Heather Hurst is an archaeological artist and illustrator who, through reconstruction, revives ancient paintings and drawings of the pre-Columbian Americas. For her palette, she draws from many different kinds of primary materials collected by archeologist collaborators – crushed, fallen building stones, field drawings, photographs, topographic maps, and functional interpretations of structures based on lab analyses of ceramics, soils, and artifacts. Through a combination of knowledge, skill, and intuition, she meticulously assembles these elements into vibrant representations of Mesoamerican visual culture. Her work with the Maya murals of Bonampak is her finest achievement to date. Through these reproductions, she conveys a sharp image of the ancient Maya world, retrieving fallen warriors and lost hieroglyphs—in short, making visible what no eyes have viewed since 800 A.D. She has produced a vivid window into the Maya past, revealing the details of forgotten monuments, their human faces, and their architectonic intentions. Her paintings and architectural renderings not only recover previously lost records, but are works of art in their own right.

	About Heather's Work

	Heather McHugh is a poet whose intricately patterned compositions explore various aspects of the human condition and inspire wonder in the unexpected associations that language can evoke. The author of eight volumes of poetry, numerous works of translation, and a book of essays on poetics, McHugh has been a significant voice in American literary life for almost four decades. In poems that are rich with wordplay — puns, rhymes, syntactical twists — she reveals the complex layers of meaning that individual words or phrases contain. The result is intellectually challenging, yet emotionally engaging verse that balances gravity with humor. In Eyeshot (2003), McHugh combines a range of literary traditions in poems that focus on our struggle to mediate the world and our place in it through the filter of sensory perceptions. She mines words for contradictions and double-meanings, offering the reader an expansive, fresh perspective on such themes as love and mortality. McHugh’s verbal playfulness and expressive range are also evident in her translation of Euripedes’ Cyclops (2001), the only surviving satyr play in Greek drama, as well as her widely respected series of essays, Broken English: Poetry and Partiality (1993). In this collection, she examines the relationship among language, culture, and poetry in works by authors ranging from Aeschylus to Dickinson to Rilke. A prolific writer of verse, translations, and essays and a dedicated teacher, McHugh has already influenced a generation of poets and will continue to enrich the art form for years to come.

	Heather Williams is an ornithologist who specializes in the field of neuroethology.

	Williams has made significant contributions to the study of mechanisms for song learning in birds and was the first to describe how the song a bird hears is processed by the motor pathways normally used for song production.  Her research interests include laterality, song organization, sexual dimorphism in song perception, kinship and song-model salience, and the mechanisms of dialect maintenance.  Her research focuses on Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), small songbirds native to the semiarid regions of Australia and Timor.  She has developed an experimental model that temporarily blocks (during the period when they learn most readily) the ability of songbirds to learn through mimicry; measuring the capability of adult birds to learn subsequently provides an index of neural and behavioral plasticity in the adult brain. Her discoveries shed light on language acquisition and may aid clinicians to improve therapies for people whose speech has been damaged through stroke, disease, or head injury.

	About Heidi's Work

	Heidi Williams is an economist unraveling the causes and consequences of innovation in health care markets. Williams combines finely grained empirical observations and custom-designed data collection methods to build entirely new datasets about technological changes in health care. In addition, her creative methods for determining causal inference, and keen understanding of regulatory law, biological science, and medical research, have allowed her to trace the interplay among institutions, market behavior, and public policy–relevant outcomes.

	Leveraging the race to decode the human genome by private and public institutions as a model, Williams reveals how the timing and nature of intellectual property restrictions affect subsequent innovation. She presents convincing evidence that a non-patent form of intellectual property protection at the early stages of scientific research limited follow-on innovation on human genes, a finding that was cited in arguments submitted to a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court case on gene patents. In subsequent work, however, she and a co-author find evidence that patent protection on human genes has in fact not substantively hindered later research or product development, suggesting that the precise design of intellectual property policies is important in shaping innovation outcomes. More recently, Williams and colleagues have investigated institutional factors affecting cancer drug development. Drugs that treat late-stage cancers take a shorter time to develop, test, and bring to market than those for earlier stage cancers. Because patent protection begins at the time of filing, rather than when a drug is actually brought to market, late stage cancer drugs have a longer period of protection and offer more potential for profit. Their work provides compelling evidence that institutional factors such as the patent system create a bias against the development of drugs to treat early stage cancers.

	Taking their findings on cancer drug development one step farther, Williams and her co-authors analyze policy measures for correcting this distortion in research priorities, including changes in how the effectiveness of a drug is established and in the timing of patent protection. Williams’s insights about market inducements for innovation and the implications of technological change in health care markets are informing institutional practice and public policy and sparking new lines of inquiry about innovation more broadly.

	Horng-Tzer Yau is a mathematician who applies mathematical insights and analysis to the explanation of important physical processes.

	His work focuses on reinterpreting descriptive models of large-scale physical behavior within the context of statistical mechanics.  Early in his career, Yau focused on describing in quantum mechanical terms the stability of matter in complex (many-body) systems.  This work produced sound mathematical support for earlier astrophysical theories on the limits of stellar stability.  He then shifted the direction of his research toward explaining the macroscopic properties of fluids based on the microscopic behavior of their constituent particles—the hydrodynamic limit.  He developed the novel concept of “relative entropy” to derive descriptive formulae of fluid behavior (for example, Navier-Stokes) from basic principles of statistical mechanics.  Although the problems that Yau works on are rooted in physical phenomena, he has made important contributions to fundamental mathematics in several areas: probability theory, nonlinear partial differential equations, spectral theory, and dynamical systems theory.

Trained as a Jesuit with a doctorate in Near Eastern Languages and Literature, he is an insightful critic and a lucid writer of marked originality, literary force, reach, and cast. His Pulitzer Prize-winning book, God: A Biography, examines the evolution of the character of God as though a figure in a work of literature, providing a unique prism through which to consider the Old Testament. He employs a similar approach in his recent book, Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God, considering not the historical Christ, but the character depicted in the stories of the New Testament. In addition to analyzing biblical literature, he is an astute observer of and commentator on religion and culture. Miles’ current focus is on religion in international relations. He is exploring links among the ethical premises of the Bible and such contemporary challenges as nuclear catastrophe and environmental degradation.

	About Jacob's Work

	Jacob Lurie is a mathematician creating a conceptual foundation for derived algebraic geometry (DAG). At an oversimplified level, he is transforming algebraic geometry to derived algebraic geometry—replacing the role of sets by topological spaces—making it applicable to other areas in new ways.

	His ideas and methods are altering a range of fields, including higher category theory, topology, and geometry, while also influencing more distant fields such as representation theory and number theory. In two major treatises, Higher Topos Theory and Higher Algebra, along with subsequent papers comprising well over two thousand pages, Lurie redefines the foundations of homotopy theory and topological aspects of algebraic geometry, showing how many known concepts and results can be recast and improved in the framework of infinity-categories.  Lurie’s work is more than just a philosophical endeavor; he includes hard theorems in his foundations, developing theory to the point that deep new results become the corollary of a general and powerful framework. Illustrative of this is his proof of the cobordism hypothesis, a result that links purely categorical concepts of duality with the topology of manifolds and also supplies a classification of topological quantum field theories.

	Lurie embraces an extraordinary breadth of vision—rewriting large swathes of mathematics from a new point of view—while also working to apply his foundational ideas to prove important new theorems in other areas. With an entire generation of young theorists currently being trained on Lurie’s new foundations, his greatest impact is yet to come.

	About Jacob's Work

	Jacob Soll is a historian whose meticulously researched studies of early modern Europe are shedding new light on the origins of the modern state. Drawing on intellectual, political, cultural, and institutional history, Soll explores the development of political thought and criticism in relation to governance from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries in Western Europe. Soll's first book, Publishing ""The Prince"" (2005), examines the role of commentaries, editions, and translations of Machiavelli produced by the previously little-studied figure Amelot de La Houssaye (1634-1706), who became the most influential writer on secular politics during the reign of Louis XIV. Grounded in extensive analysis of archival, manuscript, and early printed sources, Soll shows how Amelot and his publishers arranged prefaces, columns, and footnotes in a manner that transformed established works, imbuing books previously considered as supporting royal power with an alternate, even revolutionary, political message. In The Information Master (2009), he investigates the formation of a state-information gathering and classifying network by Louis XIV's chief minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683), revealing that Colbert's passion for information was both a means of control and a medium for his own political advancement: his systematic and encyclopedic information collection served to strengthen and uphold Louis XIV's absolute rule. With these and other projects in progress — including an intellectual and practical history of accounting and its role in governance in the modern world and a study of the composition of library catalogues during the Enlightenment — Soll is opening up new fields of inquiry and elucidating how modern governments came into being.

	Jad Abumrad is a radio host and producer whose engaging audio explorations of scientific and philosophical questions captivate listeners and bring to broadcast journalism a distinctive new aesthetic. As co-host and producer of the nationally syndicated program Radiolab, Abumrad employs his background as a composer to orchestrate dialogue, music, and sound effects into compelling documentaries that draw listeners into investigations of otherwise intimidating topics, such as the nature of numbers, the evolution of altruism, or the science of emergent phenomena within ant colonies and other complex systems. As a result of his meticulous editing and conversational approach to interviews with experts, the structure of Radiolab episodes often mimics the scientific process itself, complete with moments of ambiguity, digressions, reversals, and surprising conclusions that evoke in audiences a sense of adventure and recreate the thrill of discovery. One humor- and insight-filled segment, entitled “A Very Lucky Wind,” tackles the subject of stochasticity, or the mathematics of randomness, by following the highly improbable route of a drifting balloon across the south of England. Another episode, “Cities,” examines a formula for predicting the demographic characteristics of cities around the globe by gathering evidence from participants in Dublin, Mumbai, Mexico City, and beyond. With these and many other Radiolab shows, accessible as radio broadcasts and as podcasts, Abumrad is inspiring boundless curiosity within a new generation of listeners and experimenting with sound to find ever more effective and entertaining ways to explain ideas and tell a story.

	James Collins is a scientist who crosses the boundaries of engineering, mathematics, and biology to explore the complex mechanisms regulating biological systems. He employs theoretical and experimental approaches to understanding movement and associated disorders. His mathematical approach to motor-pattern generation helps to explain locomotion in two-, four-, and many-legged animals. In clinical settings, Collins has demonstrated that the dynamics of foot pressure distribution during quiet standing can provide a useful gauge of stiffness in patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Much of his research concentrates on understanding how biological signals can be either degraded or, counterintuitively, enhanced by noise. His laboratory has shown that introducing tiny, random vibrations in footpads markedly improves the ability of older people with peripheral nerve deficits to remain steady on their feet. Collins has recently applied his understanding of the biophysics of noise to the control of gene networks in living cells. His group has devised both experimental (i.e., a genetic toggle switch) and statistical methods for probing the genetic interactions that regulate intracellular physiologic balance. Throughout his research, Collins demonstrates a proclivity for identifying abstract principles that underlie complex biological phenomena and for using these concepts to solve concrete, practical problems.

	About James' Work

	James Longley is a filmmaker whose intimate portraits of people in politically volatile countries in the Middle East are deepening our understanding of the historical and cultural dimensions of the region’s conflicts. For his low-budget, self-financed films, Longley lives among ordinary families, gaining access to people in places rarely chronicled on film by Westerners. He captures his subjects in very personal settings and situations, revealing both the inhumanity of everyday life under conditions of war, political chaos, and economic devastation and the parallel universe of courage, resilience, and resistance. While describing a place, a people, and a circumstance, Longley’s early film in Gaza and his later films in Iraq offer unflinching portrayals of the costs and casualties of civil and international conflicts. For his highly acclaimed film Iraq in Fragments (2006), he spent two years in the country without the protection of private security or the assistance of a film crew. In a trilogy of compelling and cinematically complex stories, he presents life in war-ravaged Iraq through the eyes of an abandoned young boy on the streets of Baghdad, the collective energy and obsession of Moqtada al-Sadr’s followers, and the agrarian solemnity of Kurdish family farmers. Sari’s Mother (2006), a short film about a family struggling to navigate the labyrinthine health care system in Iraq, illustrates the human casualties of a broken governmental bureaucracy and a failed medical infrastructure. Through these films and others in development, Longley is illuminating the beauty of foreign lands and providing Western audiences with a critical new perspective on communities living under extremely challenging conditions.

	Jane Richardson studies the three-dimensional structures of proteins and RNA, emphasizing the underlying principles of their architecture, aesthetics, interrelationships, and folding mechanisms.

	Along with her husband, David, she used x-ray crystallography to determine the molecular structures of individual proteins.  Comparisons among these protein structures led the Richardsons to identify the “Greek key” and other folding patterns, and to discover that pattern similarities result from folding preferences, not necessarily evolutionary relationships.  She has received recognition for her graphic representations, both computer and hand drawn, of protein structures.  Widely reproduced, these drawings have influenced the way proteins are visualized.  The Richardsons helped pioneer the use of synthetic “designed” proteins to study the basic rules that govern their folding into the complex and unique three-dimensional structures that confer biological function.  Their recent all-atom contact analysis methods can improve the accuracy of three dimensional macromolecular structures.

	About Janine's Work

	Janine Jagger, an epidemiologist, is a leader in the design and dissemination of means and strategies to protect health care workers from the transmission of blood-borne diseases. Each year in the United States, more than half a million health care workers are stuck by contaminated needles and other sharp medical devices, resulting in major psychological and physical trauma. In landmark research, Jagger proved that injury risk was related to specific device design features, thereby reorienting the debate about protecting health care workers from changing their behavior to improving the design of the devices they use. In 1985, she and her associates designed some of the first needlestick protective devices recorded by the U.S. Patent Office. In the early 1990s, she developed the Exposure Prevention Information Network (EPINet), which is now used in some 1,500 hospitals. Her research and analyses guide design engineers in their efforts to improve the safety of medical devices. Her surveillance system is employed in countries around the world. As director of the International Health Care Worker Safety Center at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Jagger is now focusing her attention on applying the lessons learned domestically to increase protection for health care workers in developing countries.

	About Jason's Work

	Jason De León is an anthropologist whose multidisciplinary approach to the study of migration from Latin America to the United States is bringing to light the lives and deaths of clandestine migrants crossing the U.S.–Mexico border into the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. He combines ethnographic analysis of migrant stories, forensic science, and archaeological research in his efforts to understand this process—who makes the journey, the routes, the means of survival and manner of death—and the human consequences of immigration policy.

	Because U.S. border security policy prioritizes surveillance in more populated areas along the border between northern Mexico and southern Arizona, undocumented migrants travel through the remote and rugged border areas, where extreme heat and cold, dehydration and hunger, and vigilantes imperil the six- to seven-day journey. De León and his students have undertaken extensive field work in the Sonoran Desert, adapting the tools and theories of archaeology for their study of the items and material artifacts left behind by migrants (i.e., an ""archaeology of the contemporary""). This research informs his ongoing Undocumented Migration Project (2009– ), which includes academic publications, museum exhibitions, forensic field studies, and public engagement. In his book The Land of Open Graves: Living and Dying on the Migrant Trail (2015), De León focuses on the estimated 300 individuals who die each year attempting to cross the border, investigating who dies trying to cross the desert, how, and what happens to their bodies when they perish. Since migrants carry few personal possessions beyond survival gear and no identification, connecting names, families, and communities to these cadavers is very difficult. Most fatalities are never reported, remain unknown to loved ones and relatives, and are never memorialized. De León recently sought advanced training in forensic science to enrich his future efforts to collect and analyze human desert remains. He has also brought these stories to the attention of the public through State of Exception/Estado de Excepción, a touring museum exhibition of the backpacks, shoes, water bottles, and other items left behind by migrants, as well as audio interviews that add the perspectives of migrants making this dangerous journey.

	By documenting and communicating the suffering and sacrifice of migrants who risk physical injury and detainment to cross the Mexican border into the United States, De León is challenging audiences to confront the complexity of international migration and American policy choices.

	About Jason's Work

	Jason Moran is a pianist, composer, and bandleader who mines a variety of musical styles to create adventurous, genre-crossing jazz performances. Moran’s signature corpus marries established classical, blues, and jazz techniques with the musical influences of his generation, including funk, hip-hop, and rock. On his solo piano album, Modernistic (2002), he explores the evolution of twentieth-century rhythmic techniques through his virtuosic execution of two-handed “stride” piano—a style used extensively by jazz artists in the 1920s—while Same Mother (2005) is a re-examination of the emotional and stylistic elements of the blues tradition. In original compositions for his ensemble, The Bandwagon, Moran uses the human voice as a starting point for melodic structure, translating speech patterns into a musical language through which the listener can reflect on the underlying connections between speech and music. More recently, Moran has collaborated with visual and performing artists and incorporated new technology in imaginative multimedia performances. His 2008 homage to Thelonious Monk, In My Mind: Monk at Town Hall, 1959, weaves together crafted and found audio and visual archival material and a reharmonization of the original big band arrangements, illustrating both Monk’s contribution to the history of jazz as well as the enduring power of the musical form. Through reinterpretation of jazz standards and new compositions of his own, Moran is expanding the boundaries of jazz expression and playing a dynamic role in its evolution in the twenty-first century.

	About Jay's Work

	Jay Rubenstein is a medieval historian elucidating 12th-century texts that grapple with the meaning of the First Crusade (1095-1099) and its profound consequences for the future of Europe. In his book Guibert of Nogent, Portrait of a Medieval Mind (2002), he examined the life and writing of an early 12th-century French monk whose major work, the Monodies, has long fascinated scholars as the first Western autobiography since Augustine’s Confessions. In addition to offering a critical reading of Guibert’s account of his own life in the Monodies, Rubenstein’s painstaking analyses of Guibert’s sermons, crusade chronicles, and portrayal of the era emerge from his keen historical, theological, and literary sensitivities. In his subsequent work, Rubenstein has explored the larger canvas of crusade histories. He demonstrated, for example, that many accounts of the First Crusade were the product of cumulative additions by different compilers, and that a lost Ur-text most likely provided the basic structure of several extant versions. He has also investigated the importance of apocalyptic expectations in the shaping of these narratives and their role in inciting a second wave to the Holy Land. Rubenstein’s thoughtful consideration of the composition of these texts reveals their important role in the evolution of medieval scholars’ approach to writing history in general. His essays on the literature of the crusades form part of an ongoing, book-length project that will trace the effects of this conflict on Europe’s political, religious, and literary culture. Rubenstein’s imaginative rendering of the historical record, paleographic skills, and elegant presentation of manuscript evidence shed valuable light on how violent events such as the First Crusade are recorded and remembered by future generations.

	About Jeanne's Work

	Jeanne Gang is an architect challenging the aesthetic and technical possibilities of the art form in a wide range of structures. Always responsive to the specific geography, social and environmental context, and purpose of each project, Gang creates bold yet functional forms for residential, educational, and commercial buildings. Her most highly acclaimed building, Aqua (2010), is an 82-story, mixed-use skyscraper in Chicago. The undulating contours of Aqua's balconies infuse the familiar high-rise profile with an unusual optical poetry; at the same time, energy-efficient features such as heat-resistant and fritted glass, rainwater collection systems, and energy-saving lighting systems address environmental concerns on a large scale. Gang's mastery of the balance between novelty and urban practicality is also evident in the Media Production Center (2010) for Columbia College of Chicago, an imaginative fusion of found material, engineering, and structural economy that reflects the avant-garde nature of the school's work in film, television, and interactive media. Her design for the in-progress Ford Calumet Environmental Center, a 27,000-square-foot resource center on an industrial site south of Chicago, includes salvaged materials from the surrounding area and incorporates advanced systems in heating, cooling, and water reclamation. International projects, such as a major residential complex in Hyderabad, India, that makes use of traditional Indian building methods and materials, further demonstrate Gang's integrative approach to contemporary building. An emerging talent with a diverse and growing body of work, Gang is setting a new industry standard through her effective synthesis of conventional materials, striking composition, and ecologically sustainable technology.

	About Jeffrey's Work

	Jeffrey Alan Miller is a scholar of early modern English literature and theology who is shedding light on the emergence of key ideas about the role of faith in daily life and government among Reformation and Renaissance scholars. In studies of John Milton and his contemporaries, Miller integrates careful readings of surviving manuscripts into the larger context of theological, political, and cultural debates that shaped their writing.

	Miller’s analysis of Milton’s reading lists, notes, and unpublished or unfinished manuscripts has revealed the evolution of Milton’s thinking on religious, governmental, and intellectual issues over time. For example, scholars have long argued that Milton’s various litanies of “belated” reading—sources he claimed to have read or discovered only after his own thinking on an issue was settled—were merely rhetorical devices he employed to support his arguments in a given text. In his study of De doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine), Miller uses Milton’s references to work by other scholars, coupled with analysis of the surviving manuscript’s physical attributes and scribal markings, to argue persuasively that Milton did, in fact, read and draw on the “belated” texts. Miller traces how these sources influenced Milton’s writing and rewriting of De doctrina. He expands on his study of Milton’s writing process in his forthcoming monograph, Signifying Shadows, which illustrates the centrality of a providential comprehension of history—that is, a Christian view of history unfolding according to God’s plan—to the composition and content of Milton’s poetry and prose.

	His deep knowledge of the writing processes and histories of Renaissance theologians and writers enabled Miller to recognize a notebook containing lists of words and short phrases as the earliest known draft of the King James Bible (KJB), the most widely used English translation of the Bible since the seventeenth century. Found in the archives of Samuel Ward, one of the translators of the KJB, the notebook represents Ward’s proposed changes to the Bishops’ Bible, which King James had instructed translators to use as their base text upon which to improve. Miller’s critical edition of Ward’s draft, currently in progress, promises to yield new insights into the translation practices and struggles over the meaning of revelation, history, and faith that informed the creation of the KJB. Miller’s expansive view of the writing process and of what constitutes a draft manuscript are changing our understanding of seminal works at the foundation of modern Christianity, philosophy, and literature.

	About Jeffrey's Work

	Jeffrey Brenner is a primary care physician creating a health care delivery model to meet the medical and social service needs of the most vulnerable citizens in impoverished communities. Determined to improve the lives of the sickest residents of Camden, New Jersey—one of America’s poorest cities—Brenner constructed a searchable database and geographic mapping of discharge data from all patients at Camden’s hospitals and discovered that a very small number of patients consumed a large share of the overall costs of health care and social supports.

	To address this issue, Brenner established the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers, bringing together doctors in community-based private practices, frontline hospital staff, and social workers across the city to participate in a strategy of comprehensive preventive and primary care. He designed a system that delivers daily information about hospitalizations to the Coalition and members of Care Management Teams. Each team is made up of a registered nurse, one or two licensed practical nurses, a health coach, and a social worker to support and help coordinate care for patients with complex medical, and often social, issues.

	Brenner has demonstrated that using this model of cooperative care—identifying and visiting high-risk patients, earning their trust, offering access to clinical services, heading off medical complications before they occur, addressing social needs before they become medical problems—can reduce repeated emergency room visits and hospitalizations and lower health care costs. Currently working with ten communities across the country, including Allentown, Pennsylvania; Aurora, Colorado; Kansas City, Missouri; and San Diego, California, on developing sustainable and accountable care systems based on the Camden model, Brenner’s collaborative approach to health care delivery is an important contribution to the national conversation on health care reform.

	About Jeffrey's Work

	Jeffrey Gibson is a multidisciplinary artist and craftsperson merging traditional Native American materials and forms with those of Western contemporary art to create a new hybrid visual vocabulary. Gibson, a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and of Cherokee descent, is forging a multifarious practice that redresses the exclusion and erasure of indigenous art traditions from the history of Western art as it explores the complexity and fluidity of identity.

	Gibson’s pieces range from garments and sculptural objects to paintings and video and often involve intricately detailed and technically demanding handwork using materials such as beads, metal jingles, fringe, and elk hide. Mixed with references from popular culture, queer iconography, and contemporary political issues, the materials take on a different meaning while also calling into question the line distinguishing contemporary art from traditional modes of cultural production. For example, Gibson transforms the punching bag—a common symbol of male heterosexual norms—into anthropomorphic sculptures ornamented with brightly colored beads and fringe skirts that evoke fashion, play with camp sensibilities, and speak to shifting gender identities. Many of the bags include text, pithy phrases, or song lyrics, such as “From a whisper to a scream” or “I put a spell on you,” that speak to societal hopes and anxieties and serve as springboards for viewers’ associations. In a series of oversized, tunic-like garments created between 2014 and 2018, Gibson derives the basic form from nineteenth-century ceremonial Ghost Dance shirts, which were believed to deflect bullets. They are constructed from fabric custom printed with original photographs and newspaper headlines, some of which refer to the continued marginalization of Native Americans through the destruction of sacred lands at Standing Rock and Big Ears National Monument.

	Gibson’s painting practice foregrounds affinities between patterns, colors, and materials long used in Native American art and those characteristic of contemporary Western and global art traditions. His investigations of color relationships and use of the grid as a structuring device engage with the history of geometric abstraction, but the pieces also recall weaving and use materials (such as elk hide canvasses, sinew, and beads) found in indigenous art. In resisting preconceived notions about what the work of a Native American artist should look like, Gibson is prompting a shift in how Native American art is perceived and historicized.

	About Jennifer's Work

	Jennifer L. Eberhardt is a social psychologist investigating the subtle, complex, largely unconscious yet deeply ingrained ways that individuals racially code and categorize people, with a particular focus on associations between race and crime. Through collaborations with experts in criminology, law, and anthropology, as well as novel studies that engage law enforcement and jurors, Eberhardt is revealing new insights about the extent to which race imagery and judgments suffuse our culture and society.

	Her studies regarding visual attention and racial bias in modern policing and criminal sentencing offer concrete demonstrations that stereotypic associations between race and crime directly impact how individuals behave and make decisions, often with far-ranging ramifications. These associations also influence the extent to which individuals are able to discern—literally, to perceive—important visual details in crime-related imagery, as well as distinguishing features in African American faces. Using statistical analysis to analyze how a defendant’s skin color and hair texture relate to the sentencing decisions of jurors, Eberhardt has shown that black defendants are more likely to receive the death penalty if their facial characteristics are stereotypically black and their victims are white. Extending this research to the criminal sentencing of juveniles, she found that simply bringing to mind a black juvenile offender led people to perceive juveniles in general as more similar to adults and therefore more worthy of severe punishment, highlighting the fragility of protection for young defendants when race is a factor. She also has examined implicit bias among law enforcement, showing that, for example, police officers are more likely to mistakenly identify African American faces as criminal than white faces; in addition, officers are more likely to judge faces that are the most stereotypically black as the most likely to be criminal.

	In response to these findings, Eberhardt has recently begun to work with law enforcement agencies to design interventions to improve policing and to help them build and maintain trust with the communities they serve. Currently working with anthropologists to better articulate the process of cognitive dehumanization that occurs to justify marginalizing and discriminatory practices, Eberhardt is unearthing nuanced insights about how we see and experience racial difference.

	About Jennifer's Work

	Jennifer Richeson is a social psychologist who examines the behavioral and cognitive consequences of prejudice and racial stereotyping to reveal original insights into the dynamics of interracial interaction. Using a broad range of empirical methods, including fMRI measures, survey techniques, implicit cognitive processing measures, and self-report measures, Richeson analyzes the experiences of members of both minority and majority groups in their interactions with one another. A key finding of her work is that such interactions require heightened self-control to combat expressions of prejudice, calling on increased cognitive effort and resulting in decreased effectiveness on other cognitive tasks. Her work provides a novel way of examining and calculating the “costs” associated with intergroup interactions. In related research, Richeson addresses factors preventing individuals from engaging in interracial interactions, finding evidence that systematic mutual misperceptions – “pluralistic ignorance” – create unnecessary psychological barriers. In other investigations, she explores motivational and contextual variables that influence how racial cues are used in categorizing other people. Bringing new life to the topic of intergroup relations, Richeson takes the lead in highlighting and analyzing major challenges facing all races in America and the continuing role played by prejudice and stereotyping in our lives.

	Jennifer Tipton is an internationally recognized lighting designer whose distinctive designs have redefined the relationship between lighting and performance. Tipton has been an important presence throughout her prolific career in dance, drama, and opera productions of all scales, and she is regarded as one of the most versatile designers working today. Best known for her work in dance, Tipton’s painterly lighting evokes mood and defines and sculpts movement. Preferring a small but powerful palette of colors, she pioneered the use of white light in theatre and dance. In Twyla Tharp’s In the Upper Room (1986) and Fait Accompli (1983), for instance, her strategic placement of white lights coupled with manufactured fog allowed dancers to enter and exit the performance space from upstage rather than the wings. They materialize, seemingly out of nowhere, only to disappear into a void, thereby reinforcing the progression of the dance as it advances and recedes, explodes and implodes. For both small theatre and Broadway productions, Tipton’s artistry interacts intimately with the work’s physical appearance and emotional resonance. Her subtle, shifting lighting for Eugene O’Neill’s A Moon for the Misbegotten (2005) gave visual support to the play’s delicate balance between vitality and deep sadness; in the final scene, the cleansing warmth of approaching dawn affirms the sense of peace and forgiveness finally achieved by the protagonists. As a committed teacher, Tipton has influenced a generation of lighting designers, and her dramatic imagination continues to push the visual boundaries of lighting design in new and exciting directions.

	About Jenny's Work

	Jenny Tung is an evolutionary anthropologist investigating the interplay between social experiences, genomics, and health. Combining field research with cutting-edge techniques for studying many genes at once, Tung is revealing the molecular mechanisms by which social and environmental stressors have long-lasting impacts on health, longevity, and evolutionary fitness.

	Her research with a population of Kenyan baboons living in the wild, about which there is nearly fifty years of longitudinal data, has found that factors such as drought, low social status, and isolation lead to significantly shorter life spans. Importantly, she and collaborators have shown that these experiences can manifest at the genomic and cellular levels, leaving signatures in the way that immune cells function in response to wounds and infections. Her work with captive rhesus monkeys indicates that such effects are causal: monkeys assigned to lower-ranking status express proinflammatory genes at higher levels than higher-ranking monkeys. These effects can also be reversed—monkeys moved to a higher status demonstrated improved immune systems and corresponding changes in gene expression. Tung’s research has important implications for human health. While associations between socially induced stress and negative health outcomes have long been observed in humans, her findings suggest there is a causal link between social and environmental adversity and poor health.

	Tung is currently expanding her research to non-primate, socially cooperative species such as meerkats, where demarcations of social roles for breeding and nonbreeding “helper” members can clarify the effects of competing demands for growth, reproduction, and immune defense. Tung is illuminating the epigenetic consequences of social behaviors and environmental conditions, thereby advancing the emerging discipline of evolutionary medicine and providing new insights for improving human health.

	About Jerry's Work

	Jerry Mitchell is an investigative reporter with the Jackson, Mississippi, Clarion-Ledger whose courageous efforts have ensured that unpunished murders from the Civil Rights era are finally prosecuted. In 1989, Mitchell began his immersion in decades-old stories of thwarted justice and undertook a meticulous review of the 1963 assassination of NAACP leader Medgar Evers. Ku Klux Klan member Byron de la Beckwith had been tried twice for this crime in 1964, and each trial ended in hung juries. By analyzing hundreds of documents and interviewing scores of witnesses, Mitchell laid the groundwork for a new trial. The case was reopened and culminated in the conviction and life sentence of Beckwith in 1994. Mitchell has since uncovered largely unknown details about many other long-dormant murder cases. His reporting has played a key role in the convictions of Klan Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers for ordering the fatal firebombing of NAACP leader Vernon Dahmer in 1966, of Bobby Cherry for the 1963 bombing of a Birmingham church that killed four girls, and of Edgar Ray Killen for helping to orchestrate the 1964 deaths of three civil rights workers in Neshoba County, Mississippi. His investment of time and painstakingly detailed research has also produced a broad range of reports on such subjects as racial reconciliation in the South and judicial bribes and chicanery in Mississippi, as well as a series on his own family’s battle against a rare genetic ailment. In an era when long-term investigative reporting is more the exception than the rule, Mitchell’s life and work serve as an example of how a journalist willing to take risks and unsettle waters can make a difference in the pursuit of justice.

His 2014 stories also revealed deep corruption inside the Mississippi corrections system, including guards opening locks to let gangs carry out killings and prisons receiving perfect scores, despite horrid conditions, from an organization headed by Mississippi corrections commissioner Chris Epps (Epps now faces corruption charges). In 2015, the nation’s oldest prosecution of a serial killer suspect will take place due to Mitchell’s articles. Mitchell is currently completing a memoir, “Race Against Time,” on his investigations into civil rights cold cases.

	About Jerry's Work

	Jerry X. Mitrovica is a geophysicist elucidating the dynamics of Earth’s crust and mantle in response to glacial melting and the resulting implications for sea level rise. Using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates statistical techniques, land- and satellite-based measurements of sea level, and geological records from previous warming periods, he develops quantitative models to predict the geometry of sea level changes in both our warming world and the geological past.

	In early work, Mitrovica upended understanding of the long-term dynamics of Earth’s surface by proposing that tectonic plates not only move laterally but can also move up and down as rocks in Earth’s mantle rise and sink, providing an explanation for enigmatic episodes of continental flooding noted by geologists. Mitrovica has also developed state-of-the-art models for predicting changes in sea level in response to glacial melting. These models take into account vertical movement of the Earth’s crust—that is, land rises in the vicinity of ice melt due to the lightened load and falls in the periphery—as well as subtle changes in the Earth’s gravity field and rotation that impact sea level. Taking all of these factors into account, Mitrovica has built on classic work to establish that sea levels do not rise uniformly (as water rises in a bathtub) when ice sheets melt; rather, the effects are much more geographically variable. He has created models that can assign the contributions that individual regions of glacial melting have on localized sea level change, essentially identifying unique sea level “fingerprints” for ice sheets and glaciers. Sea levels actually fall near the location of melting ice sheets (as the land rises and the gravitational pull of the ice sheets diminishes) but rise higher elsewhere, often in populous coastal areas. For example, Mitrovica determined that ice melting in particular regions of Antarctica causes higher than average sea level rise along the eastern seaboard of the United States and northern Europe, while melting in Greenland will impact these regions less than the global average.

	Understanding the rate of ice melt and glacial collapse as climate changes is critical to forecasts of sea level rise. To deepen our understanding of the fate of ice sheets in a warming world, he and collaborators are also examining the geophysical, geological, and geodetic (Earth’s shape and gravitational field) signatures of ice sheet and sea level changes over vast time periods, providing key constraints on ice volumes and stability during previous warm periods in Earth history. Mitrovica is reshaping our understanding of the complex relationship between sea level and melting ice sheets and the variable impact that climate change will have on specific communities.

	About Jesmyn's Work

	Jesmyn Ward is a fiction writer exploring the bonds of community and familial love among poor African Americans in the rural South. She is the author of three novels and a memoir, all set in the Gulf Coast region of her native Mississippi and centered on marginalized black communities. In prose that is simultaneously luminous and achingly honest, Ward captures moments of beauty, tenderness, and resilience against a bleak landscape of crushing poverty, racism, addiction, and incarceration.

	The novel Salvage the Bones (2011) follows the four siblings of the Batiste family as they protect and nurture each other in the days leading up to and just after Hurricane Katrina. Ward transcends the brutal reality of their experiences—pit bull fights, a missed opportunity to attend college, a pregnancy at fifteen—through the narration of Esch, who imagines herself as a triumphant Medea, a strong, beautiful, and legendary leader. Sing, Unburied, Sing (2017), Ward's most recent novel, is wider in its scope, moving back and forth in time and including the voices of ghosts and the people they haunt. Ward does not shy away from uncomfortable truths or how her characters' own flawed choices contribute to their situations. Leonie and Michael's drug addiction and selfish love for one another force their young son, JoJo, to assume the role of parent to his toddler sister. When the family journeys upstate to pick up Michael from Parchman Prison, JoJo encounters the ghost of Richie, a young boy who died at the prison in the 1940s, revealing the long legacy of Parchman both in JoJo's family and as a tool for oppressing black communities in Mississippi.

	In her novels and nonfiction accounts of her own experiences with loss and injustice, Ward is offering a raw and powerful portrayal of the circumscribed possibilities and lost potential faced by many African Americans after generations of racial and economic inequality.

	About  Jessie's Work

	Jessie Little Doe Baird is a linguist who is reviving a long-silent language and restoring to her Native American community a vital sense of its cultural heritage. Wampanoag (or Wôpanâak), the Algonquian language of her ancestors, was spoken by tens of thousands of people in southeastern New England when seventeenth-century Puritan missionaries learned the language, rendered it phonetically in the Roman alphabet, and used it to translate the King James Bible and other religious texts for the purposes of conversion and literacy promotion. As a result of the subsequent fragmentation of Wampanoag communities in a land dominated by English speakers, Wampanoag ceased to be spoken by the middle of the nineteenth century and was preserved only in written records. Determined to breathe life back into the language, Baird founded the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project, an intertribal effort that aims to return fluency to the Wampanoag Nation. She undertook graduate training in linguistics and language pedagogy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she worked with the late Kenneth Hale, a scholar of indigenous languages, to decipher grammatical patterns and compile vocabulary lists from archival Wampanoag documents. By turning to related Algonquian languages for guidance with pronunciation and grammar, this collaboration produced a 10,000-word Wampanoag-English dictionary, which Baird continues to develop into an essential resource for students, historians, and linguists alike. In addition to achieving fluency herself, she has adapted her scholarly work into accessible teaching materials for adults and children and leads a range of educational programs—after-school classes for youth, beginning and advanced courses for adults, and summer immersion camps for all ages—with the goal of establishing a broad base of Wampanoag speakers. Through painstaking research, dedicated teaching, and contributions to other groups struggling with language preservation, Baird is reclaiming the rich linguistic traditions of indigenous peoples and preserving precious links to our nation’s complex past.

	About Jill's Work

	Jill Seaman is a physician committed to delivering and improving treatment for infectious diseases endemic to Southern Sudan, one of the most remote, impoverished, and war-torn regions of the world. She first began treating the Nuer tribespeople of Sudan’s Western Upper Nile province in 1989, as an epidemic of visceral leishmaniasis — a deadly, parasite-borne infection — devastated the already conflict-ravaged and malnourished population. In the midst of a civil war, she worked with Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) to set up makeshift clinics and offer the only treatment option for an area with no health care infrastructure, electricity, or running water. After Doctors Without Borders left Sudan in the late 1990s, Seaman established her own medical organization to continue her work in Sudan during its dry season. (She spends the remaining portion of each year in Bethel, Alaska, providing health services to Yup’ik Eskimo communities.) In response to the challenge of caring for semi-nomadic and illiterate patients suffering from life-threatening diseases, Seaman has devised field-appropriate protocols for administering complex and lengthy regimens of daily injections. She has conducted rigorous investigations on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of epidemic leishmaniasis with the goal of developing faster diagnostic methods and identifying affordable drug combinations to reduce the duration of therapy. Though the leishmaniasis crisis has subsided in recent years, Seaman continues to apply her wealth of field expertise to the rapid spread of tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B throughout East Africa and to train local staff, thus extending the reach of her practice. By adapting the tools of 21st-century medicine to address the needs of those in abject poverty, Seaman serves as a pioneering authority on how to provide life-saving medical care in all but impossible conditions.

	About Jin-Quan's Work

	Jin-Quan Yu is a synthetic chemist pioneering new techniques for the functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bonds. In order to create many of the chemical compounds used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science, inert C–H bonds in organic molecules must be broken so that a more complex cluster of atoms (the functional group) can be chemically attached—a process known as C–H functionalization. Activation of C–H bonds requires the use of metal-based catalysts that are guided to the targeted bond by other nearby directing functional groups (or ligands), which often must be removed to yield the desired product once the new functional group is attached.

	Yu has made several significant advances in the efficiency, specificity, and practicality of palladium-catalyzed C–H functionalization. He and collaborators have expanded the possibilities for tailored C–H activation by extending the distance between the C–H bond and the directing functional group much further than previously possible. They have also developed modified amino acids that can act as “transient directing groups” for a variety of ketone and aldehyde substrates. The amino acids automatically attach and remove themselves from the compounds to be modified and can be continually re-used, thereby streamlining a time-consuming process of pre-installation of directing groups and reducing the amount of reagents used. The amino acids can be selected to direct the chirality of the resulting products, a critical step in the production of effective pharmaceuticals. Most C–H functionalizations generate mirror image products at the site of the activated bond, but often only one of these (the right- or left-hand chiral form) has a drug’s desired properties.

	Most recently, Yu invented a new method for activation of methylene groups, which are the most common class of C–H bonds. Using palladium catalysts bearing amino acid– or quinoline (from coal tar)- derived chiral ligands, he has both drastically accelerated this process and enabled the creation of products with specific chirality. Yu’s unconventional approach to C–H functionalization is creating a paradigm shift in the logic of organic synthetic chemistry and breaking down barriers to the development of versatile compounds with enormous benefits to academic, industrial, and pharmaceutical research.

	About Joan's Work

	Joan Snyder is an accomplished artist whose abstract paintings defy categorization and traverse genres. Over the four decades of her prolific career, Snyder’s body of work has continually evolved in style and form. Beginning with her early “stroke” paintings — intense swaths of color painted over pencil-drawn grids — her works have been essentially narratives of both personal and communal experiences. In these paintings, each brush stroke is like a character in a story, pulsing with emotion and vitality. After abandoning formal grids as the basic structure of her paintings, Snyder’s work became more explicitly gestural and rooted in memory, while at the same time more complex materially. She began to incorporate text scrawled into the paint or frames, as well as found objects such as herbs, sticks, feathers, mud, and nails, to create works saturated with feeling. In The Cherry Tree (1993), for instance, a work expressing Snyder’s grief surrounding her father’s death, she uses paint, papier-mâché, and straw to render an image that is both elegiac and thriving. While her paintings mirror her personal experience, the visual messages she provides through her images convey universal and readily understood emotions. Through a fiercely individual approach and persistent experimentation with technique and materials, Snyder has extended the expressive potential of abstract painting and inspired a generation of emerging artists.

	About John's Work

	John Rich is a physician, scholar, and a leader in addressing the health care needs of one of the nation’s most ignored and underserved populations—African-American men in urban settings. By linking economic health, mental health, and educational and employment opportunities to physical well-being, Rich’s work on black men’s health is influencing policy discussions and health practice throughout the United States. He has created clinical programs that promote health by addressing overall wellness, recognizing that young, urban men of color face especially difficult challenges in accessing health care. Taking an original approach to social epidemiology, he conducts in-depth personal interviews with young black men to understand and underscore the contextual details attending prevalent illnesses and the cycle of violence that creates recurrent injury risk. Among his many interventions, Rich established the Young Men’s Health Clinic at the Boston Medical Center, which provides primary care to men ages seventeen to twenty-nine, many of whom are victims of urban violence. He also initiated the Boston HealthCREW, a community health-worker training program for young black men to conduct peer outreach in general health education and men’s reproductive health. By focusing on the realities of the lives of young African-American men, John Rich designs new models of health care that stretch across the boundaries of public health, education, social service, and justice systems to engage young men in caring for themselves and their peers.

	About John's Work

	John Rogers is a materials scientist noted for his contributions to applied physics, particularly his leadership in developing flexible electronic devices. In contrast to traditional solid-state electronics, where components are fabricated on semiconductor wafers, researchers have recently discovered that a host of organic (i.e., carbon-based) molecules can also act as semiconductors. In an early line of research, Rogers used microlithographic stamping technology to design high-density, complex circuits that could be fabricated on a flexible substrate similar to paper. He has raised the performance of such circuits substantially, to the point that they are finding their way into devices with modest speed requirements, such as commercial display technologies. Nevertheless, the capacity of known organic semiconductors to perform high-speed computations remains limited. To address this, Rogers has also devoted significant effort to developing flexible semiconducting films, based on silicon or carbon nanotubes, literally to stretch the boundaries of signal processing capacity on flexible substrates. Such devices can be placed in locations where standard silicon wafer technologies are impractical or impossible; the myriad of potential applications include photovoltaic cells, adaptive optics, electronic textiles, and implantable biomimetic circuits. Through his basic research in nanotechnology, chemical engineering, and applied physics, Rogers is building the foundation for a revolution in manufacture of industrial, consumer, and biocompatible electronics.

	John Bonifaz is a public interest lawyer who uses innovative litigation to reexamine campaign finance reform arguments typically debated on first amendment grounds.

	Through the National Voting Rights Institute, Bonifaz recasts legal arguments to focus on fourteenth amendment protections, challenging the relationship between money and politics. His pioneering Yale Law and Policy Review article, “Equal Protection and the Wealth Primary” (1994), which he co-authored, outlines the legal strategy with which he and the Institute have approached the controversial 1976 Buckley v. Valeo Supreme Court ruling. While Buckley v. Valeo equates campaign spending with first amendment free speech, Bonifaz examines campaign financing from the standpoint of fourteenth amendment equal protection rights. This strategy places campaign finance practices in a tradition of voting rights law, and asks whether these practices are fair and democratic and whether money effectively disenfranchises those unable to contribute to political campaigns.  On both affirmative and defensive fronts, Bonifaz and the Institute are leading the legal movement to identify new and compelling arguments in support of reform.

	About John's Work

	John Dabiri is a biophysicist whose work draws on a wide range of fields—including theoretical fluid dynamics, evolutionary biology, and biomechanics—to unravel the secrets of one of the earliest means of animal locomotion. He studies some of the simplest multicellular organisms, jellyfish (medusae), which propel themselves by contracting cells in their bell-shaped outer skin and generating jet forces in the tail end, with tentacles trailing behind. From a theoretical engineering perspective, he has shown that elucidating the mechanisms of locomotion depends on detailed mathematical analysis of the fluid vortex rings that jellyfish form in the surrounding water by contracting their bell; his results significantly increase our knowledge of the impact of size and speed on the formation of optimal vortex rings. Because the relative impact of viscosity on propulsion decreases with greater size, fluid dynamics theory implies that rowing becomes a more efficient means of locomotion as animals grow larger. Dabiri and colleagues confirmed this experimentally by examining propulsion during maturation and in adult specimens of varying size across hundreds of species, and they also found that a hybrid jet-paddling motion brings the advantage of drawing nearby prey into the bell, where the tentacles can capture them. Dabiri has invented a method that allows divers to use tiny reflective particles to visualize, with high speed and fine spatial resolution, the fluid dynamics of propulsion by jellyfish in their native habitats; this technique provides a wealth of new data that can be used to test and refine models of vortex behavior. Dabiri’s research has profound implications not only for understanding the evolution and biophysics of locomotion in jellyfish and other aquatic animals, but also for a host of distantly related questions and applications in fluid dynamics, from blood flow in the human heart to the design of wind power generators.

	About John's Work

	John Schwarz is a theoretical physicist whose research has contributed to the reconciliation of quantum mechanics and general relativity.

	In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Schwarz and a collaborator, Michael Green, pushed the superstring theory beyond its alleged limits.  They found that the supposed obstacles that blocked all attempts to reconcile Einstein’s theory of relativity with quantum mechanics were avoided when this expanded superstring theory was applied.  He has continued to explore new developments in superstring theory and has demonstrated that several theories once thought to be distinct are actually different manifestations of this single, underlying theory.

	Biography

	Schwarz is the Harold Brown Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology.  He is the co-author of Superstring Theory (2 vols. 1987), and of Special Relativity: From Einstein to Strings (2004).  He is the editor of Superstrings: The First Fifteen Years of Superstring Theory (1985) and has published numerous scientific papers in such journals as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA.

	Schwarz received an A.B. (1962) from Harvard College and a Ph.D. (1966) from the University of California, Berkeley.

	About John's Work

	John Henneberger is an advocate for fair and affordable housing who has created a new paradigm for post-disaster rebuilding. The devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina exposed the failure of federal, state, and local governments to adequately respond to the needs of the poor and of persons with disabilities.

	Skilled at identifying points of agreement among parties with varying, often opposing, economic interests and political views—such as developers, elected officials, and community members—Henneberger was an architect of a conciliation agreement with the State of Texas for Hurricanes Dolly and Ike post-disaster rebuilding. This agreement transformed the way that Texas and its local governments address affordable housing, community development, and fair housing and inspired new rule-making at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It has helped to restore equity in disaster assistance for persons with disabilities and racial and ethnic minorities; expanded low-income residents’ involvement in disaster rebuilding; and served as a model for the allocation of disaster rebuilding funds in other states. Henneberger has also worked with architects and community development corporations to rebuild housing better and more rapidly after disasters. He organized a competition that challenged architects to design a permanent home that could be quickly delivered and assembled, cost less than a FEMA trailer, and be both easily expandable and attractive. The first homes were built and occupied in 2009 and improved versions of these homes are currently being constructed.

	Henneberger has a track record of negotiating seemingly small changes in state and local policies and housing practices that enjoy a broad consensus and significantly improve the supply of affordable housing and access to fair housing. For example, he and colleagues worked with government and private agencies to pool housing data to create an online affordable housing counselor. Widely respected across a broad spectrum of stakeholders, Henneberger is working to define new standards for fair housing protections and affordable housing.

	Biography

	John Henneberger received a B.A. (1976) from the University of Texas at Austin. He began his work engaging in and supporting grassroots housing advocacy in 1974 as a volunteer with the Clarksville Neighborhood Center in Austin, Texas, and he co-authored Housing Patterns Study: Segregation and Discrimination in Austin, Texas (1979) for the City of Austin Human Relations Commission. Henneberger led several community development corporations (1979–1988) prior to co-founding the Texas Low Income Housing Information Service in 1988.

	John Kamm has designed and implemented an original approach to freeing prisoners of conscience in China by leveraging business relationships. Beginning in the 1970s as a businessman in China, he learned that the understanding of partners' motivations and constraints is vital for commercial trade in China. Having built longstanding ties of personal trust with Chinese officials at many levels, Kamm found that approaching them with dignity and respect facilitated their response to his inquiries and uncovered a wealth of information regarding the status and well-being of thousands of political prisoners (most of whom attract little attention outside China). He has mastered the details of Chinese prosecutorial, judicial, and prison systems and holds the Chinese government accountable for implementing its own regulations, rather than citing international standards alone. More broadly, he has made apparent to Chinese officials that their treatment of political prisoners sends clear signals regarding their good faith in trade negotiations. Kamm's pragmatic, case-by-case strategy complements human rights advocacy based on international conventions and principles. Having won the release or improved the conditions for hundreds, he has demonstrated his approach as an effective means of addressing contentious human rights issues with Beijing.

John Keene,2018-06-15,53,Male,Writer,"Department of African American and African Studies, Rutgers University","Newark, New Jersey",Fiction and Nonfiction Writing,"
                  
	About John's Work 

	John Keene is a fiction writer exploring the ways in which historical narratives shape contemporary lives while simultaneously re-envisioning these narratives from the perspectives of those whose voices have been suppressed. Through innovations in language and form, he imbues with multifaceted subjectivities those who have been denied nuanced histories within the story of the Americas—primarily people of color and queer people—and exposes the social structures that confine, enslave, or destroy them.
	His first book, Annotations (1995), is simultaneously a semi-autobiographical novel chronicling the coming of age of a black, queer, middle-class child in the 1970s and ‘80s in St. Louis and a collection of essays about the ideological, philosophical, and political contexts that define his struggle to achieve agency. In the story collection Counternarratives (2015), Keene reimagines moments, both real and fictional, from the history of the Americas, adopting the language and literary forms of the time periods in which his characters live—from seventeenth-century epistolary novels to Modernist and post-modernist experiments with stream of consciousness.  One story, “Gloss on a History of Roman Catholics in the Early American Republic,” is framed as an excerpt from a history book. As the text unfolds, it is revealed that what at first appears to be a footnote about the disappearance of a convent school in early nineteenth-century Kentucky is in fact the eyewitness account of Carmel, an enslaved girl who achieves literacy and a literary voice within the space of the work. “A Letter on the Trials of the Counterreformation in New Lisbon,” also narrated by an enslaved person, turns a letter between missionary priests into an assertion of queer African presence in the New World. In “Rivers,” Keene imagines two meetings between an older Huckleberry Finn and a now-free Jim; he endows Jim with a voice and consciousness, thereby presenting Tom Sawyer and Huck from a powerful new perspective that extends and transforms Twain’s original novels.

	In his fiction and in a number of other projects spanning translation, poetry, and cultural criticism, Keene is correcting and enlarging our distorted, partial views of American history and culture, and challenging his readers to question received understandings of our past.

	About John's Work

	John Novembre is a computational biologist whose work sheds new light on human evolutionary history, population structure and migration, and the etiology of genetic diseases. He develops novel data visualization and analysis techniques to investigate the correlations among genomic diversity, geography, and demographic structure. In early work, he uncovered vulnerabilities in a classic approach to analyzing the geographic distribution of genetic diversity—principal component analysis (PCA)—and upended a long-standing interpretation of PCA waves as indicators of large-scale migration events. He went on to leverage this finding and, with collaborators, established a strong correlation between shared ancestral geography and genetic similarity among Europeans. This research affirmed the importance of place in determining DNA patterns and showed that it is often possible for ancestry to be pinpointed within a couple hundred miles through genetic sequencing.

	Novembre has also developed a new approach for estimating recombination rates using ancestry blocks of admixed populations. Recombination is the fundamental biological process by which genetic material from parents is combined in an individual before being passed to offspring; the recombination rate describes how many recombination events—or points on the genome where the genetic material switches from one parent to another—are happening over time in a group. Novembre and colleagues were able to infer recombination rates across African American genomes (representing a largely West African and European admixture only several hundred years old) by identifying the breakpoints of African and European ancestry. This work has led to a highly detailed genetic map for African Americans, which provides a tool for improving studies of the genetic origins of disease and is inspiring new inquiry into genetic diversity across the globe.

	Novembre has also made key insights concerning the impact of natural selection on both positive and negative genetic variants, as well as the link between the population explosion of the last few centuries and the inordinate plethora of rare, deleterious variations in the contemporary genome. Through his unique approach to important biological questions, Novembre is producing a more finely grained picture of human genetic history and differentiating the impact of genetic and nongenetic factors in the features of current populations.

	About John's Work

	John Ochsendorf is a structural engineer and architectural historian who works to preserve historic structures and to reinterpret ancient technologies for contemporary use. In a discipline whose practitioners rarely venture into comparative cultural and historical studies, Ochsendorf is a pioneer in exploring alternative engineering traditions. His early studies investigated the construction of hand-woven, fiber suspension bridges that spanned the deep ravines and connected the territories of the Inca Empire. In addition to conducting fieldwork in Peru and analyzing historical accounts of these bridges, he developed a method for testing the strength of the ancient rope-weaving technique to produce the first data on its performance. His cross-cultural interest in bridges also led him to in-depth studies of suspension and cable-stayed bridges in Japan. More recently, Ochsendorf has turned his attention to identifying the causes of vault and buttress failures in French and Spanish Romanesque churches. Applying his understanding of structural mechanics to problems of masonry construction, his detailed analyses of barrel-vaulted churches are helping to evaluate the safety and condition of particular buildings and to develop practical strategies to address their vulnerabilities, stabilization, and restoration. For another recent project, Ochsendorf led his students in the design of England’s Pines Calyx dome, a robust, energy-efficient structure built from local resources using a tile vaulting system patented in the 19th century by Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino. While conducting structural assessments of historic monuments around the world, Ochsendorf develops new methods for establishing the stability of ancient buildings and draws important lessons from them that will guide the construction of more efficient architecture in the future.

	About John's Work

	John Zorn is an accomplished saxophonist, a versatile composer, an improvisational maestro, and an ardent promoter of experimental music.  His music defies convention and explores the spaces between and among genres.  In his eclectic orchestrations, including solo works, chamber ensemble pieces, and compositions for complete orchestra, Zorn dismantles, reconstructs, merges, and refines disparate musical idioms. His experimentation with rhythm, harmony, symphony, and instrumentation creates highly original musical landscapes. In his recording, Aporias (1998), Zorn’s precise orchestrations demonstrate the breadth of his talent as a composer, while in Cobra (2002), his improvisational virtuosity stands out as a model of extemporaneous and collaborative ensemble practice. His 2005 recording, At the Mountains of Madness, showcases the powerful sound of Zorn’s octet, Electric Masada. Additionally, as an entrepreneur, he nurtures a broad spectrum of experimental performance through his production label Tzadik, and through The Stone, a performance space and incubator for improvisation among rising talent and veteran collaborators. Through all his endeavors, Zorn is defining and championing experimental possibilities in a vibrant and evolutionary music world.

	Biography

	John Zorn is a largely self-taught artist who, since the mid-1970s, has been at the center of what has come to be called “downtown” music, based on his residence and collaborations in lower Manhattan. He performed and recorded numerous albums as part of the band Naked City, which he formed in 1989, and, in 1994, he started Masada, a four-piece jazz band and songbook project devoted to forging a new form of Jewish music.

	About Jon's Work

	Jon Kleinberg is a computer scientist with a reputation for tackling important, practical problems and, in the process, deriving deep mathematical insights. His research spans diverse topics ranging from computer networking analysis and routing, to data mining, to comparative genomics and protein structure. He is best known for his contributions to two aspects of network theory: ""small worlds"" and searching the World Wide Web. Since the original demonstration by Milgram, it has become widely understood that any two people are linked by a relatively small number of connections among mutual acquaintances (""six degrees of separation""). Kleinberg extended this concept by introducing the notion of navigability – essentially, the information structure of the network necessary for individuals efficiently to make distant connections based solely on local information. Surprisingly, he was able to prove that, while certain architectures can be computationally efficient, no algorithm can find the shortest path in networks with short, random connections. This demonstration has important implications both in sociology and in distributed network architecture design (e.g., peer-to-peer file sharing). In addition, Kleinberg has developed an algorithm for identifying the structure of web site interactions; his algorithm distinguishes ""authority"" sites, which contain definitive information, from ""hub"" sites, which refer to authority sites using hyperlinks. Beyond immediate application in the development of web search engines, this algorithm makes it possible to identify communities of interest on the web without explicit effort needed by members (even without awareness of the existence of the community).

	About Jonathan's Work

	Jonathan Lethem is the author of six novels, a novella, two short story collections, and a volume of essays that explore, in various ways, the relationship between so-called high art and popular culture. Characterized by narrative leaps between vastly divergent genres, his fiction weaves the conventions of noir mysteries, westerns, science fiction, and comic books into coming-of-age tales that are otherwise evocative and realistic in content. In his most recent novel, Fortress of Solitude (2003), he depicts the intricate codes of childhood street life he navigated while growing up in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn during the 1970s, a time when the neighborhood was gentrifying and rife with race and class tensions. Demonstrating keen powers of observation and description, he embeds his readers deeply within the physical and social worlds his characters inhabit, in the schoolyards, on the stoops, and in the midst of the energetic dialogue and pop riffs that pulse throughout. While comic book motifs appear in Fortress, Lethem’s earlier novel, Motherless Brooklyn (1999), takes the form of a detective story that is ceaselessly interrupted by the outbursts of its highly unconventional narrator, a Tourettes-plagued private investigator named Lionell Essrog. By orchestrating such allusions to popular genres within his fiction, Lethem heightens emotional engagement with his characters, blurs boundaries across a broad spectrum of cultural creations, and expands the frontier of American fiction.

	Jonathan Lethem studied at Bennington College (1982-84) and immersed himself in the culture of literature by working as a bookseller at numerous bookshops in New York City and in Berkeley, California.

Jonathan Rapping,2014-06-15,48,Male,Criminal Lawyer,Gideon's Promise,"Atlanta, Georgia",Criminal Justice,"
                  
	About Jonathan's Work

	Jonathan Rapping is a lawyer and legal defense advocate addressing failures of the U.S. criminal justice system to provide client-centered representation for indigent Americans. A large and growing number of those accused of felonies (by some estimates as high as 80 percent) cannot afford to pay for legal counsel. Though provided lawyers at no charge by the court system, often the accused are represented by public defenders burdened with too many cases and too few resources, resulting in over-incarceration or wrongful convictions that irreparably disrupt the lives of not only the indicted individuals but of their families and communities as well.

	To address this problem, in 2007 Rapping created the Southern Public Defender Training Center, subsequently renamed Gideon’s Promise. Named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case Gideon v. Wainwright, Gideon’s Promise teaches public defenders to work more effectively within the judicial system by providing coaching, training, and professional development as well as a supportive network of peers and mentors from around the country. Since its founding, the organization has grown from a single training program for 16 attorneys in 2 offices in Georgia and Louisiana, to a multi-tiered enterprise with over 300 participants in more than 35 offices across 15 mostly Southern states. An initial three-year “Core” program for new public defenders has since expanded into a comprehensive model that includes programs for graduates of the initial Core program as they continue their development, public defender leaders, trainers and supervisors, and law students. Further, the organization is unique in that it intervenes at the trial stage, rather than after conviction, where challenges to criminal injustice often take place.

	In 2014, Rapping established a partnership with the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, marking the first time the Gideon’s Promise model will be integrated into a statewide defender system. Rapping’s effective and replicable model of teaching, mentorship, and professional networking is an innovative prescription for equitable legal defense and is safeguarding the essential democratic right of every American to high-quality legal representation regardless of ability to pay.

	Biography

	Jonathan Rapping received an A.B. (1988) from the University of Chicago, an M.P.A. (1992) from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, and a J.D.

	About Jonathan's Work

	Jonathan Shay is a clinical psychiatrist whose treatment of combat trauma suffered by Vietnam veterans combined with his critical and imaginative interpretations of the ancient accounts of battle described in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey are deepening our understanding of the effects of warfare on the individual. His book, Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character (1994), draws parallels between the depiction of the epic warrior-hero Achilles and the experiences of individual veterans whom he treats at a Boston-area Veterans Affairs’ Outpatient Clinic. Reading the poem through the lens of modern experience, Shay rediscovers important nuances that traditional scholarship has often understated in the classical text, particularly that the Iliad is fundamentally a story about the frequently contentious relationship between soldiers and their leaders. In Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming (2002), using Odysseus as metaphor, Shay focuses on the veteran’s experience upon returning from war and highlights the role of military policy in promoting the mental and physical safety of soldiers. A passionate advocate for veterans and committed to minimizing future psychological trauma, Shay strives for structural reform of the ways the U.S. armed forces are organized, trained, and counseled. Respected by humanists and military leaders alike, Shay brings into stark relief the emotional problems faced by military combatants and veterans, ancient and modern.

	Jorge Pardo is an artist whose visually seductive body of work explores the intersection of contemporary painting, design, sculpture, and architecture. Employing a broad palette of vibrant colors, eclectic patterns, and natural and industrial materials, Pardo’s works range from murals to home furnishings to collages to larger-than-life fabrications. He often transforms familiar objects into artworks with multiple meanings and purposes, such as a set of lamps displayed as both sources of illumination and as freestanding sculptures, or a sailboat exhibited as both a utilitarian, seaworthy vessel and as a striking obelisk. Working on small and monumental scales, Pardo also treats entire public spaces as vast canvases; for one project, he used dramatic, multicolored tile work to redesign the ground floor of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City. For other projects, he has challenged traditional curatorial presentation with installations that consciously ignore the constraints of conventional museum and gallery spaces. His construction and outfitting of a complete house for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a wooden jetty overlooking a lake for Skulptur Projekte Münster in Germany represent examples of his unique artistic approach. In reaching beyond defined aesthetic disciplines, Pardo is engaging viewers in the United States and abroad with works that produce great visual delight while questioning distinctions between fine art and design.

	About José's Work

	José A. Quiñonez is a financial services innovator creating a pathway to mainstream financial services and non-predatory credit for individuals with limited or no financial access. A disproportionate number of minority, immigrant, and low-income households are invisible to banks and credit institutions, meaning they have no checking or savings accounts (unbanked), make frequent use of nonbank financial services (underbanked), or lack a credit report with a nationwide credit-reporting agency. Without bank accounts or a credit history, it is nearly impossible to obtain safe loans for automobiles, homes, and businesses or to rent an apartment.

	Quiñonez is helping individuals overcome these challenges by linking rotating credit associations or lending circles, a traditional cultural practice from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, to the formal financial sector. Lending circles are typically informal arrangements of individuals pooling their resources and distributing loans to one another. Through the Mission Asset Fund (MAF), Quiñonez has created a mechanism for reporting individuals’ repayment of small, zero-interest loans to credit bureaus and other financial institutions. MAF participants are able to establish a credit history and gain access to credit cards, bank loans, and other services, and lending circles focused on youth provide individuals with fees for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival applications and apartment security deposits (which are particularly needed by youth aging out of foster care). All participants are required to complete a financial training class and are provided with financial coaching and peer support. Since the lending circles were established in 2008, participants’ credit scores, collectively, have increased an average of 168 points.

	Quiñonez has established a network of partnerships with the financial services industry to enable other organizations to replicate his approach. With Quiñonez and MAF providing the technology necessary to disperse and track loans (a significant hurdle for many nonprofits) and assisting in securing local partners and investors, 53 nonprofit providers in 17 states and the District of Columbia are now using this powerful model in their communities. Quiñonez’s visionary leadership is providing low-income and minority families with the means to secure safe credit, participate more fully in the American economy, and obtain financial security.

	About Joseph's Work

	Joseph Curtin is a master violinmaker who crafts original, world-class violins for the twenty-first century. A luthier with research interests in nontraditional materials, nontraditional structures, and violin acoustics, Curtin weds acoustic science to the art of violinmaking and merges time-honored techniques with new materials and design. Having first excelled in the traditional practice of creating replicas of the great Italian instruments of Stradivari and Guarneri, Curtin is now confronting the dilemma of the evolution of the violin, creating entirely new instruments that incorporate contemporary materials and aesthetics. In so doing, he has collaborated with leading acoustics researchers in the field, experimenting with violin acoustics, playability, sound, and ergonomics. His approach consists of an artful synthesis of the old and new and offers clear evidence that the centuries-old art of violinmaking is still evolving. Using new methods of construction and affordable modern composite materials to improve the instrument’s response and sound, he produces violins and violas of remarkable tone, power, projection, and timbre. Driven by a desire to experiment and innovate, Curtin builds distinctive violins of enduring quality that are increasingly recognized worldwide as instruments of the highest order.

	Biography

	Joseph Curtin studied violin at the University of Western Ontario (1971-73) and music and philosophy (1974-77) at the University of Toronto. He abandoned musical performance for lutherie when he came under the tutelage of violinmaker, Otto Erdesz, in 1977. He apprenticed with Erdesz for several years and worked in workshops in Italy and France. In 1985, he established a workshop with partner, Gregg Alf, with whom he built instruments for twelve years under the name Curtin & Alf. He founded his independent workshop, Joseph Curtin Studios, in 1997. He also co-directs the Violin Society of America’s acoustic workshop at Oberlin College, is a trustee and contributing editor for the Catgut Acoustical Society, and is a regular contributor to The Strad magazine.

	About Joesph's Work

	Joseph DeRisi is a molecular biologist who develops and uses new technologies for exploring the complex, interdependent pathways regulating gene expression. He extends the impact of recent advances in DNA sequencing by examining not just the population of genes within a cell, but also their interactions that lead to complex behaviors. DeRisi uses glass slides, carefully prepared with spots of DNA, arranged by robotic devices in a microarray, to make hundreds and even thousands of measurements of individual gene expression from a single experimental sample. His studies on the most common type of malaria parasite have revealed an unusual pattern of synchronized gene activity. This observation suggests that the infectious agent may be particularly sensitive to drugs that disrupt the gene synchronization necessary to move into the next phase of its life cycle. DeRisi has also demonstrated the power of microarrays for rapid characterization of unknown viral strains; he and colleagues used this method to identify and characterize a novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in early 2003. By enhancing methods for bulk measurement of gene activity and applying this technology to questions of vital biological and medical interest, DeRisi demonstrates the vast potential for discoveries in molecular genetics to decode the mysteries of cellular function and to advance the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

	About Josh's Work

	Josh Kun is a cultural historian exploring the ways in which the arts and popular culture are conduits for cross-cultural exchange. In work that spans academic scholarship, exhibitions, and performances, Kun unearths and brings to life forgotten historical narratives through finely grained analyses of material and sonic manifestations of popular culture. He complicates our understanding of the evolution of racial and ethnic identity in America in works such as Audiotopia (2006), a comprehensive comparative study of African American, Jewish American, Mexican American, and Mexican popular music, and the co-authored And You Shall Know Us by the Trail of Our Vinyl (2008), a close reading of over 400 Jewish music album covers.

	More recently, Kun has turned his attention to the diverse and vibrant culture of Los Angeles, with an emphasis on bringing present-day communities together around historical intersections of cultural expression. To Live and Dine in LA: Menus and the Making of the Modern City (2015) uses taste—and political, economic, and sociological undertones of eating—as points of entry into urban history. An accompanying exhibition and a series of public events in Los Angeles introduced local and national audiences to a fascinating yet easily overlooked aspect of the city’s past. Kun created a similar multiplatform presentation of the Los Angeles Public Library’s collection of Southern California sheet music from the 1840s to the 1950s. Including a book, Songs in the Key of Los Angeles (2013), new recordings, and an exhibition, the project culminated in a free public concert that brought together diverse communities to hear Stevie Wonder, Jackson Browne, and other performers share their music in a spirit of unity and inclusiveness.

	In these and many other projects, including cultural studies of the U.S.-Mexico border, Kun is showing how communities that may have historically been seen as separate actually have much in common. At the same time, his dedication to identifying new ways to make the histories of cultural production tangible for the public is demonstrating the power of public humanities at its best.

	About Joshua's Work

	Joshua Oppenheimer is a documentary filmmaker illuminating the social, psychological, and emotional dimensions of controversial subjects in works that redefine the dynamic between filmmaker and subject, film and audience. Through a unique mode of filmmaking that mixes the real and the invented, he is challenging the modern aesthetic of contemporary documentary cinema in both intimacy of focus and visual construct. Two early works, The Entire History of the Louisiana Purchase (1998) and These Places We’ve Learned to Call Home(1996), use archival footage, on-screen interviews, and fantastical settings to humanize religious extremists, antigovernment militia members, and science fiction fanatics.

	In conducting interviews for his 2003 film, The Globalization Tapes, which brings to light the little-known exploitation of low-wage plantation workers in Sumatra, Indonesia, Oppenheimer began to explore the national political violence of 1965–1966. The resulting film, The Act of Killing (2012), challenges audiences to observe and reflect upon a state-sponsored massacre of civilians. In 1965, the disposition of then-President Sukarno in favor of the U.S.-backed President Suharto led to the massacre of as many as two million citizens labeled communists or “enemies of the state.” After teaching himself to speak the local language, Oppenheimer spent several years identifying and interviewing hundreds of former death squad members, some of whom agreed to participate in on-screen re-creations of their crimes. The behind-the-camera recollections of events, casual interviews, and deliberate stagings culminate in a disturbing collage of theater and remembrance through the eyes of the executioners who did not hide their crimes decades ago and publically boast about them now, offering an unusually intimate view of the psychology and social networks of living mass murderers. The audience becomes engaged in a profound drama about recognition and self-knowledge, as we see both the subjects’ attempts to restage their crimes and their reactions to what has been filmed when Oppenheimer plays it back for them.

	Oppenheimer’s latest film, The Look of Silence (2014), centers on the survivors of these victims as they courageously examine the role of their neighbors in the governmental purge. Through this film diptych and essays about the art and arc of filming these stories, Oppenheimer is creating an opportunity for broad accountability and eventual healing in a community that has been grieving for nearly half a century and prompting new ways of thinking about impunity, complicity, and contrition in the context of state-sponsored violence.

	About Joshua's Work

	Joshua Tenenbaum is a cognitive scientist working at the intersection of computational cognitive science, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to investigate how the mind works. The human mind can acquire knowledge from very limited input and rapidly sort through noisy, conflicting information to reach judgments. Tenenbaum is one of the first to develop and apply probabilistic and statistical modeling to the study of human learning, reasoning, and perception, and to show how these models can explain a fundamental challenge of cognition: how our minds understand so much from so little, so quickly. 

	He and his group have demonstrated that the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms that give rise to mental capabilities such as categorization, causal inference, and concept and language learning mirror Bayesian statistical approaches. Such approaches define the probability of a random event as determined by our prior beliefs and observed evidence rather than by the frequency (or pattern) by which it occurs. For example, Tenenbaum has shown that people’s estimates of the duration of an event, given just a single observed time point, closely correspond to the predictions of optimal statistical models, and his computational models of how children learn words from just one or a few examples have yielded insights into how children acquire their language skills. Tenenbaum supports his theoretical work with behavioral experiments with children and adults that demonstrate the effectiveness of his models in making quantitative predictions of human behavior. He has also used video game simulation engines and probabilistic programs to model how the mind constructs its intuitive physics and psychology—that is, how people develop an intuitive understanding of the ways physical objects and intentional agents interact in the world.

	Tenenbaum has recently broadened his focus to the implications of his work for artificial intelligence and machine learning, which traditionally require much larger data sets for learning than humans typically employ. Tenenbaum is deepening our understanding of how the mind works and is making important contributions to bringing artificial intelligence closer to the capabilities of human cognition.

	About Josiah's Work

	Josiah McElheny is a sculptor who draws from the decorative and functional traditions of glass to craft a new, multifaceted form of contemporary art. Often using narratives inspired by the histories of art, design, and glass as points of departure, McElheny creates objects of exceptional formal sophistication, exquisite craftsmanship, and conceptual rigor. While the beauty of his blown glass objects invite viewers into his installations, the narratives behind each piece encourage thoughtful reflection upon the objects’ significance. One of McElheny’s most ambitious projects, An End to Modernity (2005), consists of a twelve-foot-wide by ten-foot-high chandelier modeled on the 1960s Lobmeyr design for the chandeliers found in Lincoln Center. Through his massive sculpture of shining chrome and transparent glass, McElheny explores the convergence of modernist design and the Big Bang theory, both of which were invented in the early twentieth-century, only to reach their widespread acceptance in the 1960s. Earlier projects have focused on subjects ranging from Roman Imperial glass to twentieth-century fashion, from sixteenth-century Italian painting to the designs of Adolf Loos. To each of these topics McElheny brings the same boundless curiosity and ability to make connections across classes of objects, historical moments, and fields of inquiry. This artist’s technical virtuosity and deep knowledge of his medium’s history have produced a captivating series of sculptures and promise more stimulating, shimmering works to come.

	About Joyce's Work

	Joyce J. Scott is a jewelry maker and sculptor repositioning craft, and in particular beadwork, as a potent platform for commentary on social and political injustices. In handmade works ranging from elaborate, over-sized neckpieces, to two- and three-dimensional figurative sculptures, to installations, Scott upends conceptions of beadwork and jewelry as domestic or merely for adornment by creating exquisitely crafted objects that reveal, upon closer examination, stark representations of racism and sexism and the violence they engender.

	“The Sneak” (1989) depicts a moment of domestic violence that has ended in murder, and the Election Day series features images of President Obama surrounded by faces expressing joy, fear, and anger. The Mammy series makes manifest the extreme sacrifices of the African American domestic servant during slavery and beyond, and several smaller pieces depicting lynching culminate in a large-scale installation entitled Lynched Tree (2011–2015). Through her adaptation of the traditional peyote stitch technique—a method of free form or off-loom beading—Scott achieves remarkably complex, freestanding sculptural forms with very little or no internal armature. Other works reflect Scott’s sly, satirical humor, as in the depiction of two parents who have been passing as white feigning shock and dismay at their dark-skinned child in “Ancestry/Progeny” (2008). The humorous aspects of Scott’s beadwork are intertwined with performance art pieces she has created throughout her career, many of them as part of the duo the Thunder Thigh Revue, that satirize representations of and stereotypes about the black female body.

	Scott continues to push the expressive potential of beading in her recent work. She integrates her trademark beadwork with blown glass sculptures in pieces created in collaboration with artisans in Murano, Italy, and she is currently at work on an outdoor installation in homage to Harriet Tubman that will be of unprecedented scale. Scott’s diverse and adventurous body of work blurs the boundaries between fine art and craft and challenges viewers to confront the darker aspects of human nature in scenes both contemporary and historical.

	Juan Maldacena, a physicist, is redefining the boundaries of mathematical physics.

	He works in the highly abstract field of string theory, which postulates the existence of fundamental constituents of matter too small to detect with current experimental apparatus. In his graduate work, Maldacena showed how radiation from a black hole can be explained within the context of string theory. More recently, he captured the attention of the theoretical physics community by postulating a critical theoretical link between the 4-dimensional structure of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and a 10-dimensional theory based on strings. By identifying a plausible method for explaining the earlier QCD theory in the context of the newer, but purely theoretical field of string theory, Maldacena’s work holds out the promise of a “grand unification” of all known physical forces.

	Juan Salgado is a community leader helping immigrants overcome barriers to success in the workplace and build the human capital of their communities. Through the Instituto del Progreso Latino, which he has led since 2001, Salgado works with members of the low-income, Latino immigrant communities on Chicago’s southwest side. Most adults in these communities work in menial jobs and face formidable barriers to upward mobility; few have high school diplomas, and many lack the English-language skills needed for a GED or vocational training program.

	Salgado has pioneered an education program that adapts the principles of contextualized learning to equip these workers with the skills that lead to higher-paying employment in manufacturing and health care, sectors with a growing demand for a diverse, multilingual workforce. Participants achieve three goals concurrently: complete an adult basic education, improve language abilities, and acquire job skills. Instituto’s Carreras en Salud program prepares adults for college-level registered nurse programs, meeting a need for bilingual health care; its Manufacturing Technology Bridge program gives workers the high-level skills needed on the modern factory floor. Instituto also provides counseling to identify and overcome other obstacles to employment, such as transportation, child care, and elder care. Salgado has raised funds from private and public sources to expand Instituto’s programs, and he has built strong partnerships with community colleges and business owners to open up further opportunities for participants to gain training and employment.

	Salgado continues to broaden Instituto’s reach. In 2010, he opened a charter school, Instituto Health Sciences Career Academy, which offers counseling and support to students beyond graduation through the first two years of postsecondary education or training. Through Salgado’s creative leadership, Instituto is widely recognized as an example of success, and it provides technical assistance to groups replicating its techniques in California, Indiana, Minnesota, and Texas. Salgado has built an effective ladder to opportunity in the Instituto del Progreso Latino, empowering individuals, lifting families out of poverty, and creating a model program with national reach.

	About Judy's Work

	Judy Pfaff is an artist in the midst of a prolific career as a sculptor, installation artist, painter, and printmaker. At the heart of her work is her exploration of how to make painting more three-dimensional and sculpture more painterly. From the beginning of her career in the 1970s, she has worked with a wide and unusual range of materials and has inspired younger artists to venture outside the traditional distinctions made between painting and sculpture. Pfaff moves back and forth easily between two- and three-dimensional work, creating art that is complex, profuse, and unique. Her dynamic, exuberant, large-scale (and typically site-specific) installations incorporate local materials and combine painting, sculpture, and architecture. These works include carefully crafted elements of her own making with found materials, both man-made and natural, to create protean forms of rich complexity. While primarily a sculptor, Pfaff’s concepts are expressed in equal power in her paintings, prints, and drawings. Her work continues to evolve, and she has recently begun to explore the incorporation of photographic/digital imagery into her installations and prints.

	About Julia's Work

	Julia Robinson was a mathematician whose work focused on the border between number theory and logic.

	Robinson was best known for the simplicity, ingenuity, and beauty of her approach to mathematical problems.  In a 1951 Annals of Mathematics article entitled “An Iterative Method of Solving a Game,” she proved what is considered by many to be one of the most important theorems in elementary game theory.  She devoted much of her research to the problem of solving a Diophantine equation, the tenth of the famed twenty-three research problems posed in 1900 by the German mathematician David Hilbert.

	Biography

	Robinson served as a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, after joining the faculty in 1976.  She was the first woman inducted into the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1975 and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984.  She was the second woman to give the American Mathematical Society Colloquium Lectures in 1980, and served as the first woman president of the American Mathematical Society (1983-84).

	Robinson received an A.B. (1940), an M.A. (1941), and a Ph.D. (1948) from the University of California, Berkeley.

	About Julia's Work

	Julia Wolfe is a composer who combines influences from folk, classical, and rock genres in works that are grounded in historical and legendary narratives. Often described as post-minimalist, Wolfe demonstrates an openness to sonic possibilities, with choral elements and instruments such as the mountain dulcimer, bagpipes, and body percussion often augmenting string and orchestral arrangements. Many of her works blur the line between music and theatrical experience.

	Wolfe’s approach to source material varies from allusion to deconstruction and re-creation. For example, her string orchestra piece Cruel Sister (2004) is based on an old British ballad about one sister murdering the other over the attentions of a suitor, but rather than retelling or quoting from the original song, Wolfe’s piece represents the emotional arc of the story. Steel Hammer (2009), a work for voice and chamber ensemble, draws upon more than 200 versions of the legend of John Henry. Competing and contradictory versions are fragmented by Wolfe, then stitched back together and mixed with the sonorities of Appalachia to produce a rich musical world that also represents a new approach to the ballad.

	Wolfe’s interest in specific American traditions and idioms, both musical and cultural, is also evident in Anthracite Fields (2014). She undertook a year’s worth of intensive research around the coal-mining region of Pennsylvania—visiting local coal mines, meeting with mining families, and studying historical imagery. The finished work, which features projected imagery, layers oral history into a musical whole that expresses the complexity of an industry that fueled the nation. Wolfe is engaging audiences of all types through her restless explorations of various musical styles and her ability to synthesize many forms of expression—music, narrative, movement, imagery—into major compositions.

	About Julie's Work 

	Julie Ault is an artist and curator activating and preserving art’s capacity to effect social change. In artmaking that takes the form of exhibition making, art criticism and theory, and historical chronicles, Ault explores how art shapes and is shaped by the political, social, economic, and aesthetic circumstances of a given moment.

	She was a founding member of and one of the driving forces of Group Material, an artist collective active between 1979 and 1996 whose collaborative approach to creating and presenting art pioneered a new model for the role of art and the artist in contemporary society. Group Material challenged the precedents of museums and galleries, displaying posters, advertisements, and other ephemera from popular culture alongside recognized art objects and using the exhibition format as a means of communicating and organizing disparate forms of information. AIDS Timeline (first exhibited in 1989), for example, combined works of art, public health statistics, policy information, and media coverage in a vital presentation of facts, context, and cultural responses to the AIDS crisis at a time when political agendas thwarted efforts to educate the broader public.

	In her more recent work, Ault has focused on research and the mobilization of materials and information to bring histories of activism in art to light. For the exhibition Afterlife: a constellation (2014), she brought together a selection of works by other artists, such as David Wojnarowicz (1954­–1992) and Martin Wong (1946–1999), their personal artifacts, and her own writing into an evocative assemblage that connected the experiences and creative practices of past and present artistic figures. Her book, Alternative Art New York, 1965–1985 (2002) documents the critical role that alternative art groups and spaces played in the development of politically progressive and inclusive practices, and she has brought the silkscreen prints of Sister Corita Kent (1918–1986), an activist artist and nun, to the attention of a large audience both within and outside of the art world through writings and exhibitions. With an unconventional approach to producing and exhibiting art and an eye toward pressing social concerns, Ault is safeguarding an ethical impulse in art as it navigates contemporary institutions of culture and power.

	About Julie's Work

	Julie Livingston is a medical historian who combines archival research with ethnography to explore the care and treatment of individuals suffering from chronic illnesses and debilitating ailments in Botswana, a middle-income country with a system of universal health care. Drawing on her interdisciplinary training in anthropology and public health, Livingston augments the history of medicine with a history of emotions, spotlighting the bodily vulnerability of populations facing the challenges of twenty-first-century political and economic development.

	Her descriptions of the adaptive responses of caregivers and communities in Debility and the Moral Imagination in Botswana (2005) illuminates how traditional healing and caregiving practices have been reshaped and reconfigured by regional political and economic dislocation and Western biomedical ideas and techniques. In Improvising Medicine: An African Oncology Ward in an Emerging Cancer Epidemic (2012), Livingston tracks Botswana’s rapidly emerging cancer epidemic by documenting the daily medical ordeals of patients and caregivers in the country’s public oncology ward. On this stage, European and African doctors and African nurses improvise with patients and their relatives to treat horrific wounds, manage acute pain, and mediate terminal illness in the face of language barriers, cultural differences, inadequate staffing, obsolete equipment and technologies, and limited supplies of critical resources.

	By unflinchingly detailing an over-extended medical infrastructure and the families and health care providers who navigate it, Livingston exposes the limits of biomedicine and the unlikelihood that technology alone will fix health issues in Africa or anywhere else. Such in-depth examination of physical impairment and terminal disability is challenging global health partners to address a very real but largely ignored crisis of care in Africa, and Livingston is poised to begin a new project about suicide in New York City that promises additional fresh and enduring insights into pressing public health concerns.

	Julie Mehretu is an artist who transforms her canvases into visually spectacular excavations of multiple epochs and locales. As a foundation and point of departure for her work, she depicts public spaces from around the globe – museums, stadiums, and international airports – in the form of heroically-scaled maps and architectural plans. On surfaces encased in coats of transparent resin, she paints over these sprawling drawings a maelstrom of colorful, geometric abstractions, iconic imagery, and loosely figurative markings that evoke a world of associations. Certain sketch marks suggest explosions, while others call to mind the curved backs of pilgrims praying at Mecca, or landscapes flecked with grassy plains. In one work entitled Transcending: The New International (2003), she renders in India ink the buildings and urban plans from all the capital cities of Africa onto one stratified topography; she includes designs from various eras and overlays these diagrams with a tumult of lines tracing the migrations and battlefronts that have crisscrossed this vast terrain. By layering multiple pictorial planes, she creates the illusion of movement, of elements advancing and receding at dizzying speeds within graphically stunning, timeless space. In so doing, Mehretu creates abstract paintings that grant viewers a dazzling glimpse of history’s vicissitudes.

	Julie Su is a public interest lawyer who has broken new ground with litigation strategies for protecting the rights of undocumented immigrant garment workers. In 1995, Su represented a group of 80 Thai women and men who were sewing garments for 18 hours a day in a sweatshop in El Monte, California. She filed a landmark federal lawsuit on behalf of these workers, establishing a precedent that expands the scope of employment responsibility beyond manufacturing subcontractors to the retailers and fashion designer labels that initially contract for the work. As a result, Su recovered monetary compensation for her clients, while earning them legal immigrant status from the U.S. government by arguing that statutes written to protect narcotics informants also apply to undocumented workers who expose the criminal behavior of their employers. Her attention to the human and legal dimensions of the abuses of immigrant laborers provides a powerful model for public advocacy.

	About Julie's Work

	Julie Theriot is a microbiologist, cell biologist, and biophysicist who is unraveling the secrets of bacterial infection. One strategy that some bacteria use to evade the immune system is to trick cells lining exposed surfaces (such as the digestive tract) into absorbing the bacteria; after several cell divisions, the bacteria propel themselves through the cell wall into adjacent cells, where the process is repeated. Theriot's research focuses on the mechanism of bacterial propulsion, specifically on the role of the structural protein actin. In early publications, Theriot showed how bacteria can commandeer the normal role of actin within the cell by inducing the formation of long bundles of actin filaments that resemble the tail of a comet. These actin comet tails then propel the attached bacterium forward. Theriot designed several experimental protocols that allow for detailed analysis of the biomechanics of this process – measuring the forces generated and determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for actin comet-tail formation. Through her research, Theriot illuminates basic biophysical processes underlying movement of cells and the pathogens that invade them.

	Junot Díaz is a writer whose finely crafted works of fiction offer powerful insight into the realities of the Caribbean diaspora, American assimilation, and lives lived between cultures. Born in the Dominican Republic and living in the United States since adolescence, Díaz writes from the vantage point of his own experience, eloquently unmasking the many challenges of the immigrant’s life. With skillful use of raw, vernacular dialogue and spare, unsentimental prose, he creates nuanced and engaging characters struggling to succeed and often invisible in plain sight to the American mainstream. In Drown (1996), an anthology of interrelated short stories, Díaz describes his narrator’s coming-of-age in New Jersey and the Dominican Republic, deftly interweaving complex chronologies, particulars of place, and shifting narrative perspectives. The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007), Diaz’s first novel, follows three generations of a family living in both the Dominican Republic and the United States. Through the striking voice of the narrator—a mix of Spanish, English, and street slang with myriad literary and popular culture references—Díaz approaches the complicated and troubled history of the Dominican Republic with humor and irony while also tracing the legacy of the violent Trujillo regime, both for those who lived through it and those who left. In these book-length works and numerous other short stories and essays, Díaz composes vivid narratives that capture the texture of day-to-day survival and draw readers into the various and distinct worlds that immigrants must straddle.

	Karen Russell is a fiction writer whose haunting yet comic tales blend fantastical elements with psychological realism and classic themes of transformation and redemption. Setting much of her work in the Everglades of her native Florida, she depicts in lyrical, energetic prose an enchanting and forbidding landscape and delves into subcultures rarely encountered in contemporary American literature.

	The vividly realized stories in her debut collection, St. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves (2006), revolve around a cast of adolescents, often parentless, caught between the worlds of childhood and adulthood, wilderness and civilization, island and mainland, the living and the dead. In her novel Swamplandia! (2011), Russell revisits and expands on the opening story of her earlier collection, “Ava Wrestles the Alligator,” to explore the intricacies and consequences of a family’s grief following the death of their matriarch. Narrated primarily by its thirteen-year-old protagonist, Ava, the novel weaves together a chilling odyssey into a swampland netherworld; lush descriptions of the flora, fauna, and history of the Everglades region; and profound observations about human nature in the face of irreparable loss.

	Russell’s recently published collection of stories, Vampires in the Lemon Grove (2013), navigates new and diverse terrain, from a nineteenth-century silk factory in Japan, to a drought-ravaged homesteader settlement on the plains of Nebraska, to the traumatic memories of an Iraq War veteran.

	Karen Hesse is an accomplished author whose innovative use of language and form, as well as her choice of often-difficult subjects, has expanded the possibilities of literature for both children and young adults. Many of her fifteen works are historical novels; readers learn about the period while being absorbed by Hesse’s riveting stories and multidimensional characters. Her prize-winning novel, Out of the Dust, takes place in Oklahoma during the Depression and is told by a feisty young girl who dreams of becoming a professional pianist. The book reveals the grimness of life in the Oklahoma panhandle during 1934 and the fourteen-year-old character’s private hardships and quiet triumphs. Hesse’s portrayal of this young girl’s growth into maturity is told in a compelling free verse, first-person narrative. Her most recent verse novel, Witness, takes on the subject of the Ku Klux Klan and its influence on a small town in Vermont in the 1920s. The story is related in the voices of a variety of townspeople, some who become Klansmen, others who oppose the organization, and some who are victims of the Klan’s violence. This work provides insight into the consequences of racism in the past and its impact on society today. Hesse’s books inspire children and young adults to contemplate and wrestle with the ideas presented and to ask questions about themselves and others.

	About Kartik's Work

	Kartik Chandran is an environmental engineer integrating microbial ecology, molecular biology, and engineering to transform wastewater from a troublesome pollutant to a valuable resource. Traditional facilities for biologically treating wastewater remove pathogens, organic carbon, and nutrients (where necessary) through decades-old technology that requires vast amounts of energy and resources, releases harmful gases into the atmosphere, and leaves behind material that must be discarded. Chandran approaches wastewater treatment with the goal of producing useful resources such as fertilizers, chemicals, and energy sources, in addition to clean water, in a way that takes into account the climate, energy, and nutrient challenges we face today.

	The key insight of Chandran’s research and applications thereof is that certain combinations of mixed microbial communities, similar to those that occur naturally, can be used to mitigate the harmful environmental impacts of wastewater and extract useful products. For example, Chandran has determined an optimal combination of microbes (and associated wastewater treatment technologies) to remove nitrogen from waste while minimizing the release of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. This approach also involves reduced chemical and energy inputs relative to traditional treatments and has the added benefit of preventing algal blooms downstream by maximizing nitrogen removal. More recently, using ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, Chandran has enabled the transformation of bio-generated methane gas into methanol, a chemical that is both easily transported and widely useful in industry (including the wastewater industry).

	Chandran imaginatively tailors his solutions to be locally appropriate. In rural Ghana, in conjunction with his Engineers without Borders students, he has re-engineered source-separation toilets to both provide sanitation and recover nutrients for use in agriculture. In Kumasi, Ghana, he is testing the large-scale conversion of sludge into biofuel while also providing new training opportunities for local engineers and managers. Through his groundbreaking research and its practical applications, Chandran is demonstrating the hidden value of wastewater, conserving vital resources, and protecting public health.

	About Kate's Work

	Kate Orff is a landscape architect envisioning new forms of public space that reveal and revive the hidden ecological systems underlying our built environments and encourage urban residents to become active stewards of their natural surroundings. Her research and design practice addresses the challenges posed by urbanization and climate change (such as biodiversity loss and rising sea levels) through in-depth collaborations with ecologists, engineers, educators, artists, and community members that aim to make our urban habitats more adaptive and resilient.

	As founding principal of SCAPE, a landscape architecture and urban design studio, Orff's work ranges from large-scale coastal infrastructure initiatives to the design of city parks, as well as book-length publications, museum exhibitions, and self-guided podcast tours that invite city dwellers to explore the natural histories of their regions. She partnered with photographer Richard Misrach to produce Petrochemical America (2012), a two-part book that documents and visualizes the interrelated economic, environmental, and public health issues facing an area of intense chemical production along the Mississippi River, stretching from Baton Rouge to New Orleans. For the Rebuild by Design competition launched by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, Orff and an interdisciplinary team of collaborators proposed a risk reduction and ecological revitalization concept for Staten Island's southern shore called Living Breakwaters. In contrast to hard infrastructure, such as flood walls, that simply displace rising water to nearby vulnerable areas, the project employs a necklace of breakwaters designed to support the growth of oyster reefs and other marine habitats and to defend against wave damage and coastal erosion. Integrated into the concept are on-shore marine education and recreation centers that will connect students and neighboring communities to the shallow water landscapes and oyster reef restoration efforts protected by the breakwaters. Construction of Living Breakwaters is scheduled to begin in late 2018. SCAPE's design for Town Branch Commons in Lexington, Kentucky, celebrates the region's porous limestone geology. The project will open up Town Branch creek, which currently flows through culverts buried beneath downtown Lexington, at strategic points along its length to create a 2.5­­-mile network of trails, parks, pools, stream channels, and storm water management systems in the heart of the city.

	Orff's resourceful design approach calls attention to the most distinctive natural attributes of a given place, while her collaborations and community outreach strategies extend the boundaries of traditional landscape architecture.

	Katherine Gottlieb has transformed health care and related health programs in her Native Alaskan community. As head of the nonprofit Southcentral Foundation, Gottlieb recast the organizational focus toward patient-centered health care and away from on mass delivery of social welfare to underprivileged populations. In the process, she elevated the quality of service to the highest standard of medical care while decreasing the demand on the most expensive resources. The reach of Gottlieb's programs extends well beyond primary care. The Dena A Coy Residential Treatment Center is the first residential facility for pregnant women in the United States focused on preventing fetal alcohol syndrome. Pathway Home, a transitional living center, addresses the challenges of substance abuse, violence, and suicide among Native Alaskan teenagers. With the Family Wellness Warriors Initiative, Gottlieb seeks to revitalize the traditional role of Native Alaskan men as protectors and providers, making them less inclined to fall into a pattern of domestic abuse. Under Gottlieb’s leadership, the Southcentral Foundation network has demonstrated that high-quality health care and effective preventive services are possible, even in communities facing obstacles of poverty and geographic isolation.

	Kay Ryan is an accomplished poet whose immediately distinctive and tightly woven verse is grounded in incisive explorations of seemingly familiar language, ideas, and experiences. Independent from schools of poetry and literary fashion, her mode of expression is a disarmingly clear and accessible style, characterized by concision, rhyme, wordplay, and wit. A part-time remedial English teacher for over thirty years at the College of Marin in Kentfield, California, Ryan published her first major book of verse, Strangely Marked Metal (1985), at the age of forty. Since then, she has published seven additional volumes of poetry, including The Best of It: New and Selected Poems (2010). In this work, Ryan's precise crafting of language and thought is revealed in such poems as ""The Edges of Time,"" a philosophical meditation in which the narrator deftly grapples with both the sense of time's fleeting quality as well as one's own mortality. In ""Green Behind the Ears,"" from The Niagara River (2005), she carefully distills an adult's complexity of feeling evoked by memories of one's youth. Drawing from the puns and implications of everyday speech to achieve a wide range of effects, Ryan conveys emotional intensity and intellectual heft in poems that are rarely longer than a page. This inventive poet has already created a distinguished body of work and will continue to compose deceptively simple verse of wisdom and elegance, surprising us with the possibilities of the medium.

	About Kellie's Work

	Kellie Jones is an art historian and curator deepening our understanding of contemporary art of the African Diaspora and securing its place in the canons of modern and contemporary art. Her research and curatorial practice, which span large-scale museum exhibitions with extensive catalogues as well as scholarly books and articles, have been instrumental in introducing the work of now seminal black artists (such as Martin Puryear, David Hammons, and Lorna Simpson) to wide audiences and bringing to light long-forgotten or overlooked black artists.

	Through the exhibition Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964–1980 (2006)—which highlighted numerous black artists working in abstract painting or sculpture—and her scholarly work on African American conceptualists, Jones has prompted a reevaluation of the view that African American art of the period was predominantly figurative or representational. At the same time, she refuses to treat the work of black artists as an isolated phenomenon, instead drawing on a keen attention to cross-cultural aesthetics and a highly developed sensitivity to the formal properties of art objects to integrate their work into the broader artistic production of the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960–1980, she both unearthed the histories of previously unknown Los Angeles–based black artists and contextualized their work alongside West Coast artists of other racial and ethnic backgrounds.

	Jones’s exploration of interracial differences and racial solidarity among the artists in Now Dig This! reflects her ongoing interest in the ability of art to shape and advance communities, a theme she returned to in Witness: Art and Civil Rights in the Sixties (2014). With over 100 works by a diverse set of artists, Witness revealed distinct aesthetic strategies informed by but also responding to the struggle for racial justice, while also making a powerful case for the role of art in the civil rights movement. Through an array of critical interventions, Jones is writing the history of African American art and redefining the contours of American art history in general.

	About Kelly's Work

	Kelly Benoit-Bird is a marine biologist who uses sophisticated acoustic engineering techniques to explore the previously invisible behavior of ocean creatures at scales ranging from swarms distributed over many cubic kilometers to individual predators. The food web of ocean surface waters begins with microscopic creatures that serve as the source of food for tiny organisms (zooplankton) just large enough to generate an acoustic signature. Although zooplankton drift in response to ocean currents, Benoit-Bird has shown that they use their modest locomotive capacity to form swarms with distinct three-dimensional structures that change with feeding conditions. Using multi-frequency acoustic backscattering, she has been able to reconstruct the feeding patterns of swimming predators of zooplankton (known as nekton) as they first pass downward through a layer of zooplankton, then reverse course and pass through upward. Having precise data about the horizontal and vertical distribution of oceanic food webs opens a new path for understanding the complexities of marine ecology. Further up the food chain, Benoit-Bird has investigated and illuminated the behavior of mammalian predators such as spinner dolphins, which hunt nekton in small, coordinated groups. These groups follow a carefully choreographed sequence of movements, repeated many times, to minimize the opportunity for the prey to escape. Using advanced acoustic engineering technology that she has modified and optimized for applications specific to her research, Benoit-Bird is addressing long-unanswered questions and providing the marine ecology community with a clearer picture of the structure and behavior of food chains.

	About Kelly's Work 

	Kelly Link is a short story writer pushing the boundaries of literary fiction in works that draw on genres such as fantasy, science fiction, and horror while also engaging fully with the concerns and emotional realism of contemporary life. The worlds of her stories are recognizably based on reality but governed by idiosyncratic, internal logics. The elements of the surreal and fantastic that emerge without explanation are by turns unsettling, heartbreaking, and hilarious.

	The familiar tedium of low-wage retail jobs, for example, is considered in the context of 24-hour convenience stores for zombies (“The Hortlak”), and a couple’s attempt to revive their marriage by moving to a house in the country fails, due to complications posed by giant bunnies and the haunting of household items (“Stone Animals”). Many of the stories collected in Get in Trouble (2015), Link’s most recent volume, take place in social landscapes marked by deep social and economic inequality. In “The Summer People,” teenage Fran faces a life of limited opportunities both because of poverty and her forced servitude to magical fairy-like creatures. She escapes on morally ambiguous terms, deceiving a classmate from an upper-class family into becoming the new captive caretaker. “Valley of the Girls” explores the consequences of excessive wealth from the perspective of the privileged. Teenagers of the very rich are protected from kidnapping and their own potentially bad choices by having body doubles act as their public “Faces.” The nonlinear structure of the story obscures the major relationships among the real teenagers and their “Faces” until halfway through the story, when with a single sentence Link clarifies the identities of the characters and the inevitable tragedy of the story’s ending.

	Link is committed to helping other writers chart their own course, much as she did; with her husband, Gavin Grant, she runs the Small Beer Press, which publishes unique voices in fantasy and literary fiction that do not appeal to commercial publishers. As a writer and an editor, Link is mapping new literary territory, and she is a source of inspiration for many young writers dissatisfied with traditional distinctions between genres.

	About Kelly's Work

	Kelly Lytle Hernández is a historian challenging long-held beliefs about the origins, ideology, and systemic evolution of America’s modern-day incarceration and immigrant detention practices. 

	Her book, Migra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol (2010), is the first significant academic history of the enforcement organization. Lytle Hernández traces the rise of the Patrol over the course of the twentieth century, from a rural community brigade with a narrow agenda to help farmers and ranchers manage the flow of seasonal workers in the 1920s to its current focus as an anti-immigration unit of the federal government. Her research took her to the Instituto Nacional de Migración (INM) in Mexico City, where she unearthed documentation about partnerships between the early Border Patrol and the Mexican state to regulate Mexican migration into the United States. Her second book, City of Inmates: Conquest, Rebellion and the Rise of Human Caging in Los Angeles, 1771–1965 (2017), is an ambitious study that reconstructs the history of how Los Angeles County built what is today the largest jail system in the United States. She builds upon what we know about the Southern enslavement of African Americans as the defining precursor to America’s racialized prison system by foregrounding how, in the American West, cultural and institutional practices targeted African Americans as well as other marginalized groups. Native populations, non-white immigrants, and even itinerant and impoverished white men encountered hyper-policing, incarceration, and eventually erasure from social privileges and the public eye. Because historical records from the L.A. County Jail and Sheriff’s Office had been destroyed, Lytle Hernández built what she calls a “rebel archive” containing materials from local agencies—including public health services, the courts, and city council—and from activists, community members, and incarcerated persons.

	While making previously unarchived records from both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border accessible to other scholars, Lytle Hernández is uncovering experiences and perspectives that shed new light on the carceral state’s complex and entangled roots in the western United States. She currently leads the Million Dollar Hoods research project, which maps the fiscal and human costs of incarceration in Los Angeles County. She is also at work on a history of the Flores Magón brothers, Mexican social reform activists who, as exiles in the United States, seeded the outbreak of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Lytle Hernández’s investigation of the intersecting histories of race, mass incarceration, immigration, and cross-border politics is deepening our understanding of how imprisonment has been used as a mechanism for social control in the United States.

	Quotes From Kelly

	My work chronicles how the diverse and colliding histories of racial violence in the American West, especially in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, drove the rise of mass incarceration in the United States. It is work that unmasks the enduring grip of white supremacy on U.S. carceral systems, from our jails to prisons to detention centers, insisting that true criminal justice reform must advance racial justice. Only with a deep and expansive commitment to racial justice, including reparations for harms done and a creative reimagining of public safety for all, especially for historically-marginalized communities, can the United States begin to break with centuries of deploying law-and-order to create and protect the inequitable distribution of resources, including but not limited to land, jobs, and housing.

	About Kenneth's Work 

	Ken Ward Jr. is an investigative journalist whose in-depth coverage of the coal, chemical and natural gas industries in West Virginia is exposing the true economic, social, and health impacts of industrial abuse on Appalachian residents and communities. As a staff writer for the Charleston Gazette-Mail for more than twenty-five years, Ward fearlessly reports on worker safety violations, environmental hazards, and corporate malfeasance of regional coal and chemical companies.

	He employs familiar tools of the journalistic trade—documentary discovery, Freedom of Information Act filings, one-on-one interviews and the like—but through a combination of tenacity, curiosity, and compassion for the residents of his home state, his investigations uncover the larger context surrounding specific incidents and inspire empathy for victims and their families. Working jointly with reporters at National Public Radio and the Center for Public Integrity, Ward uncovered decades of government inaction around black lung disease that allowed it to continue to afflict miners even as regulators and politicians assured the public it was no longer a threat. Subsequently, the Mine Safety and Health Administration instituted new regulations. His reporting on a 2014 chemical spill that contaminated the drinking water of 300,000 people included an examination of the widespread lack of emergency planning and accident prevention in the coal and chemical industry. In his current work for the ProPublica Local Reporting Network, he is investigating the growth of the natural gas industry in West Virginia and its impact on communities and the environment.

	About Kenneth's Work

	Kenneth Catania is a neuroscientist whose investigations of mammalian insectivores, particularly the star-nosed mole, provide fundamental insights into the organization of the sensory cortex. The star-nosed mole, a near-blind, wetlands-dwelling rodent, relies on fleshy tactile tendrils surrounding its nose to locate and identify prey underground. In his early work, Catania showed that the somatosensory cortex of these animals is organized in spatial maps corresponding to the sensory organ itself; this discovery represents a correspondence to the organization of the visual cortex in most other mammals. By investigating natural variations in the number of sensory tendrils, he was able to show that the somatosensory maps reorganize according to the morphology of the organ, implying that the sensory inputs themselves shape the cortical organization during development. Recently, Catania used foraging theory to show that the star-nosed mole approaches the theoretical maximum speed for locating and consuming food; he postulates that the remarkably fast neural processing of sensory input represents a necessary adaptation to the ecological niche of this insectivorous mole species. Through his integrative approach to understanding an unusual animal model, Catania generates new insights into the mammalian cortex — how it evolves, how it develops, and how it responds to changing conditions.

	Kerry James Marshall is an artist whose paintings portray allegorical depictions of African-American themes and subjects.

	Marshall's paintings render an ordinary and often overlooked subject matter – lower and middle class African-American existence – with flair, assurance, and rich pictorial detail.  Conceptually experimental and artistically innovative, Marshall also builds on an enormous range of knowledge and admiration for the traditions of art history and western painting practices.  A classical idiom in concert with traditions of Haitian design, folk art, and the dimensional elements of African, tribal sculpture lends his subjects a larger-than-life allegorical status.  His large-scale canvases display a complex layering of diverse references and techniques to celebrate African-American culture while questioning the ways in which America has constructed social identity.

	About Kevin's Work

	Kevin Eggan is a developmental biologist at the forefront of addressing fundamental questions about cellular differentiation and plasticity; in addition to their importance to basic biology, these questions hold essential implications for developing therapeutic stem cell lines from adult cell nuclei. His research explores the mechanisms by which somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning) can reverse the differentiation of a cell by “reprogramming” its nucleus to the totipotent state. His accomplishments place him at the forefront of a most exciting new branch of biology: the use of nuclear transfer and stem cell technologies to explore mammalian development, i.e., how a single cell grows into a complex organism. In an important study of X chromosome inactivation in cloned mouse embryos, Eggan demonstrated that the nuclear transfer procedure leads to epigenetic reprogramming of the donor genome. More recently, he showed that nuclei of even highly specialized cells, such as olfactory neurons which express only a single odorant receptor, retain full developmental potential. After careful review by independent human subjects and ethics panels, Eggan received permission in June 2006 to initiate efforts at Harvard to create embryonic stem cell lines from skin cells of patients suffering from several debilitating or terminal diseases. By exploring the possibilities of redirecting stem cells from adult tissue or differentiated tissue, Eggan is moving us an important step closer to developing therapeutic applications for diseases such as Parkinson’s and insulin-dependent diabetes, as well as providing an experimental platform for investigating the genetic and environmental factors that give rise to such diseases.

	About Kevin's Work

	Kevin Guskiewicz is a researcher and athletic trainer who has made major advances in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of sports-related concussions. Each year, approximately 3.8 million athletes in the United States experience mild traumatic brain injuries, or concussions. Through a combination of laboratory and on-the-field research, Guskiewicz has played an important role in raising awareness about the prevalence and dangers of sports-related brain injuries in both professional and youth athletics. He was among the first to identify the long-term effects of multiple concussions, including cognitive impairment and depression in later life, through large-scale epidemiological studies of retired professional football players. Recognizing the inadequacy of traditional concussion screening tools — most rely solely on an athlete's self-report of symptoms — Guskiewicz demonstrated that postural control, or balance, serves especially well as an objective measure in the evaluation of concussive episodes. His portable and cost-effective Balance Error Scoring System is now widely used by athletic trainers at colleges and secondary schools to diagnose and manage injury more accurately and rapidly. Guskiewicz's recent work focuses on the cumulative effects of repetitive, sub-threshold brain impacts. Using accelerometers embedded in the helmets of college football and youth hockey players, he and colleagues are investigating the relationship between magnitude and number of head impacts and clinical symptoms of concussion. Taking this research a step further, he is working directly with collegiate football players and coaches to identify dangerous hits in real time and to correct improper tackling techniques associated with sustaining concussions. While engaging clinicians, coaches, parents, and athletes in recognizing the immediate and long-term effects of concussions, Guskiewicz is contributing significantly to state and federal policy discussions concerning development of more stringent return-to-play guidelines and head-gear investigations that will improve the safety of athletes of all ages.

	About Kevin's Work

	Kevin M. Murphy is a wide-ranging economist with an aptitude for applying careful empirical analyses within rigorous theoretical frameworks to economic questions of immense social import. Early in his career, Murphy identified how trends in wage inequality reflect underlying changes in demand for labor. These studies not only considered such variables as work experience, education, race, and gender, but also highlighted the importance of within-group wage variability in understanding labor economics. Murphy also considered the phenomenon of addiction from an economic perspective. Contrary to widely‑held beliefs that addiction distorts economic judgment, Murphy and colleagues developed a model of ""rational addiction"", in which consumers anticipate the expected future consequences of their current actions; he developed empirical analyses supporting this model from data on cigarette consumption. Using his model in conjunction with a structural analysis of the industry, Murphy explained the counterintuitive observation of increasing profits for cigarette manufacturers despite decreasing demand for their products. More recently, he has shown that, particularly for conditions such as heart disease and cancer, investment in basic health research and care results in orders of magnitude returns in economic value. In these areas, and many others, Murphy challenges preconceived notions and attacks seemingly intractable economic questions, placing them on a sound empirical and theoretical footing.

	Khaled Mattawa is a cultural ambassador and poet-translator of Arabic poetry giving voice to a vast literature largely unknown in the Western hemisphere. In masterful translations that evoke the rhythm and cadence of Arabic, he renders the beauty and meaning of the poems accessible to an English reader.

	He has published English translations, many the first available, of the work of contemporary poets highly respected in the Arab world, such as Amjad Nasser (Jordan), Saadi Youssef (Iraq), Adonis (Syria), and Fadhil Al-Azzawi (Iraq), as well as women poets whose names may be less familiar, such as Iman Mersal (Egypt), Joumana Haddad (Lebanon), and Maram Al-Massri (Syria). His translations do not replicate the meter or rhyme of the original, nor do they mimic traditional English forms; rather, they are creative reproductions with words translated or replaced, sentences and spaces rearranged, but with fidelity to the author’s spirit. The translated poems occupy a transitional space between two cultural traditions. Mattawa’s own poetry exhibits a similar quality, blurring time and space to impart the complexity of a transnational identity.

	In addition to his work as a poet and translator, Mattawa has also written insightful essays on contemporary Arab and Arab American poetry and co-founded the Arete Foundation of Arts and Culture to support and promote the creative arts in Libya. Through his critical essays, his poetry, and his translations, Mattawa serves as a mediator between Arab and American culture and highlights the invaluable role of literary translations in bridging cultural divides.

	About Kristen's Work

	Kirsten Bomblies is a young molecular biologist who is shedding light on the mysteries of how new species originate. As a graduate student, she investigated how teosinte, an inedible grass indigenous to Mexico, was domesticated into a commodity crop — corn. Bomblies participated in experiments showing how a single gene, tga1, which controls development of the female inflorescences (ears), can be modified such that the fruitcase is essentially inverted, exposing the edible portion of the fruit. She and her colleagues extended these results by identifying two genes that may control the number of rows of grain. Her more recent series of investigations as a postdoctoral fellow have examined the role of incompatible hybrids as a mechanism for speciation in a shared ecological niche. Using the classical model of plant genetics, the flowering weed Arabidopsis thaliana, Bomblies showed in over 1,000 hybrid crosses that some plants developed a necrotic syndrome similar to the reaction caused by a pathogen. She demonstrated that a family of about 100 genes known as R (resistance) genes, which offer protection against predation, can in particular combinations generate an autoimmune syndrome that prevents a plant hybrid from thriving. Since only certain combinations of R genes are mutually compatible, this observation provides a molecular genetic mechanism for generating reproductively isolated subsets within a previously homogeneous community at a common location. Bomblies is currently expanding these observations further in Arabidopsis and testing their generality in other plant species. Her findings provide a surprising molecular genetic mechanism linking developmental and evolutionary biology, and thus may represent a key advance in both disciplines.

	About Kristina's Work 

	Kristina Olson is a psychologist shedding light on the social and cognitive development of transgender and gender-nonconforming youth, an increasingly visible population that has been largely overlooked by prior scientific research. Her work is broadly concerned with the development of social cognition in children, particularly how children identify with social groups and the emergence of biases based on social categories such as gender, race, and class.

	These interests have led her to focus on cases where children’s personal senses of identity are at odds with the way they are categorized and perceived by others. Through the TransYouth Project, she is conducting the first large-scale, longitudinal study of transgender and gender- nonconforming child development and engaging a participant cohort of over 300 children from around the country who are living as their preferred gender. For the project’s initial study, Olson examined patterns of gender cognition of non-trans and transgender elementary-aged children using both self-report measures and computer-administered implicit association tests, which were based on participants’ automatic reaction times to images most relevant to them. Olson’s study is one of the first quantitative demonstrations of consistent gender cognition patterns among gender-matched, but not sex-matched, peers, as her results indicate close alignment between the groups sharing the same gender identity and marked differences between the two groups sharing the same assigned sex. In light of higher incidences of mental health problems and suicidal behavior among transgender adolescents and adults, her investigations also address questions about the mental health and well-being of socially transitioned children who are supported to live openly as their preferred gender. (Social transitions are reversible, nonmedical interventions that often involve changing the name and pronouns used to describe a child, as well as his or her hairstyle and clothing.)

	Her studies of socially transitioned children suggest that mental health problems are not inevitable within this population, and that the children she is following, who are supported in their gender identity, do not display higher levels of depression and only slightly higher levels of anxiety than a control group of peers. In addition to advancing the scientific understanding of gender, Olson’s rigorous research is already informing standards of care guidelines for clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and pediatricians, and it holds the potential to yield valuable insights about how transgender youth function psychologically as they enter adolescence and adulthood.

	About Kyle's Work

	Kyle Abraham is a choreographer and dancer probing the relationship between identity and personal history through a unique hybrid of traditional and vernacular dance styles that speaks to a new generation of dancers and audiences. With diverse training in music, visual art, and dance—and breathtaking skill as a performer—Abraham’s highly physical dance vocabulary reflects the youthful energy of the hip-hop and urban dance he encountered in his adolescence as well as a strong grounding in modern dance technique.

	In works for his own company, Kyle Abraham/Abraham.in.Motion, and others, startling shifts in gestures and music create a rich dialogue between internal emotional landscapes and shared cultural experiences. The Radio Show (2010), set in his native Pittsburgh, juxtaposes Abraham’s feelings of dislocation and loss as he witnesses his father’s decline due to Alzheimer’s with the bereavement of the African American community after the abrupt departure of a beloved urban radio station that had served as an integral means of communal dialogue.

	In his most recent work, Pavement (2012), Abraham creates a moving and powerful portrait of urban life consumed by gang and police violence, employing a score that incorporates baroque opera, contemporary classical compositions, and R&B as well as multimedia elements and spoken word. Near the end of the piece, the recurring motif of bodies forced onto the ground into a handcuffed position takes on new meaning: as the six dancers move into different arrangements of stacked bodies, with dancers wriggling out or turning over to face those above, we see that while often filled with brutality, their lives are also marked by a powerful camaraderie that can be a source of comfort and beauty.

	Although early in his career, Abraham is establishing a singular choreographic style and creative vision for exploring important contemporary issues with a clarity and beauty that resonates with a wide range of audiences.

	L. Mahadevan is a mathematician who applies complex mathematical analyses to a variety of seemingly simple, but vexing, questions across the physical and biological sciences — how cloth folds when draped, how skin wrinkles, how flags flutter, how Venus flytraps snap closed. Through his explorations of shape and motion, in many different material types, sizes, and time frames, Mahadevan strives to identify commonalities of the fundamental nonlinear and nonequilibrium behavior driving them. One line of his research considers the relationship between the biochemistry and mechanics of structural molecules that form polymers, such as actin, within the cell. These investigations have parallels in his work on the hydrodynamics and elasticity of thin films and sheets (e.g., made of fabric). Mahadevan also considers properties of materials at larger scales, such as cell shape, adhesion, and migration in developmental biology, avalanche dynamics, or the role of water in determining the tensile characteristics of plants. Though he searches for and elucidates mathematical principles underpinning these complex behaviors, his focus remains on developing hypotheses that can be confirmed or rejected empirically in the lab. The unusually broad scope of his theoretical and experimental investigations defies facile categorization, but they are linked by an effort to discover the geometric and mechanical principles that determine the behavior of complex biological and physical systems.

	About LaToya's Work

	BiographyLaToya Ruby Frazier is a photographer and video artist who uses visual autobiographies to capture social inequality and historical change in the postindustrial age. Informed by documentary practices from the turn of the last century, Frazier explores identities of place, race, and family in work that is a hybrid of self-portraiture and social narrative. The crumbling landscape of Braddock, Pennsylvania, a once-thriving steel town, forms the backdrop of her images, which make manifest both the environmental and infrastructural decay caused by postindustrial decline and the lives of those who continue—largely by necessity—to live amongst it.

	The Notion of Family, a series of unflinching black-and-white photographs, shows her mother, grandmother, and the artist herself in a Braddock unmoored by disinvestment and demographic decline. Frazier’s stark portraits underscore the connection between self and physical space and make visible the consequences of neglect and abandonment—unemployment, environmental health crises, and lack of access to services—for Braddock’s historically marginalized working-class African American community. In a photolithograph and silkscreen print series from 2011, entitled Campaign for Braddock Hospital (“Save Our Community Hospital”), Frazier sets up an ironic juxtaposition between upbeat consumer capitalism and the challenges of working people. Images of Braddock from a 2010 Levi Strauss campaign bearing the slogan “Ready to Work” are set in counterpoint to quotes from Braddock residents about the closure of the town’s only hospital—and its principal employer—that same year.

	In more recent photographic work, Frazier documents Braddock from the skies in full-color aerial shots that record the extensive transformations of a community after years of economic collapse. Frazier’s uncompromising and moving work illustrates how contemporary photography can open conversations about American history, class structures, and social responsibility.

	Lateefah Simon, the executive director of the Center for Young Women’s Development (CYWD) in San Francisco, leads a distinctive and bold program to guide troubled girls from delinquency and poverty to healthy and productive adulthoods. In the service of impoverished teens and young women with histories of drug addiction, prostitution, or abuse, many living on the streets and some with criminal records, the Center offers a path towards improved self-esteem and economic stability. Simon hires young women who have faced similar challenges to serve as mentors, providing them job training, health insurance, and a living wage. By tapping into the talent and experiences of street-smart young women, she instills a sense of community that young women use to help themselves and each other out of difficult circumstances. Her strategy recognizes several elements to successful transition. To turn their lives around, young women in trouble need guidance navigating the criminal justice system and emotional support from people they can trust. To give themselves a chance for a better life, these women also need to maintain their health, learn employable skills, and develop leadership potential. Simon and her colleagues at the Center have developed peer-mentoring programs to address each. Beyond the specific projects of her organization, though, Simon demonstrates the immense potential of leadership, diligence, resourcefulness, and vision for effectively addressing seemingly intractable social challenges.

	Otis’s work illuminates the unexpected interrelationship of scientific advances and literature in the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth centuries.  Her first book, Organic Memory: History and the Body in the Late Nineteenth & Early Twentieth Centuries (1994), describes how the now-abandoned biological postulate of heritable memories manifested in literature, philosophy, and psychology at the turn of the previous century.  More recent work focuses on a metaphor of communication, exploring how nineteenth-century technology—such as the telegraph—reflected the transformation of social relations.  These books demonstrate how specific scientific and technical developments can take on larger metaphorical meanings that permeate political and literary discourse.  She is also the author of Membranes: Metaphors of Invasion in Nineteenth-Century Literature, Science, and Politics (1999) and Networking: Communicating with Bodies and Machines in the Nineteenth Century (2001) and the editor of Nineteenth-Century Literature and Science: An Interdisciplinary Anthology (2002).

	Biography

	Otis is a professor of English and liberal arts at Emory University.

	Otis earned a B.S. (1983) from Yale University, an M.A. (1985) from the University of California, San Francisco, and an M.A. (1988) and Ph.D. (1991) from Cornell University.

	About Laura's Work

	Laura Poitras is a filmmaker whose elegant and illuminating documentaries capture the lives and intimate experiences of families and communities largely inaccessible to the American media. Following an early career in experimental film, Poitras turned her attention to contemporary social issues, offering insight into complex topics with a unique cinematic lyricism. Her signature work, a trilogy of feature-length documentaries about America’s post–September 11 war on terror, explores the human consequences of military conflict abroad from unusual vantage points, reflecting relationships she forges over months and years of close interaction. My Country, My Country (2006), filmed entirely by Poitras while working alone in Iraq, paints a compelling portrait of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni physician running for political office in Iraq’s first democratic election, and of a country seeking peace and stability under American occupation. In The Oath (2010), filmed in Yemen and Guantanamo Bay, Poitras contrasts the stories of Abu Jandal, a former jihadist and bodyguard to Osama bin Laden, and of his brother-in-law, Salim Hamdan, who became the first man to face an American military tribunal. The “oath” in the title refers to Jandal’s initial allegiance to Al Qaeda and his subsequent renunciation of it following 9/11, but it also alludes to the pledge of loyalty to the United States of an FBI interrogator who testifies before Congress against enhanced interrogation techniques. The final film of the trilogy, shot in the United States and as yet untitled, focuses on the personal impact of prolonged international conflict on those abroad and at home. In these and other works in progress, this courageous filmmaker is chronicling some of the most pressing issues of the twenty-first century, particularly the war on terror.

	Biography

	Laura Poitras studied filmmaking at the San Francisco Art Institute and the New School. Her additional works include the film Flag Wars (co-director, 2003) and the video installation O’ Say Can You See (2011). Her films have been shown at such venues as the Sundance Film Festival, the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the Museum of Modern Art, and the San Francisco International Film Festival, among others.

	About Lauren's Work

	Lauren Redniss is an artist and writer seamlessly integrating artwork, written text, and design elements in works of visual nonfiction. Redniss undertakes archival research, interviews and reportage, and field expeditions to inform every aspect of a book’s creation, from its text, to its format and page layout, to the design of the typeface, to the printing and drawing techniques used for the artwork. Her intimate, idiosyncratic perspective illuminates widely varying subjects.

	In Century Girl (2006), Redniss tells the story of Doris Eaton Travis, a Ziegfeld Follies star and traveling showgirl who died in 2010 at age 106. Redniss sets Travis’s colorful life against the backdrop of twentieth-century history with art that combines drawings, newspaper clippings, and photographs into surreal collages. Redniss’s biography of Marie and Pierre Curie, Radioactive (2010), is both the story of the Curies’ love affairs and a history of their scientific discoveries. The glow-in-the-dark cover and eerie blue-tinged cyanotype prints evoke Marie Curie’s description of radium’s “spontaneous luminosity.” Diary entries, letters, and narrative accounts of the Curies’ lives are punctuated by sobering reminders of the repercussions of their work—Hiroshima, Chernobyl, underground and atmospheric atomic tests.

	In Thunder and Lightning (2015), Redniss conveys the sensations of wonder, terror, and chaos that the forces of nature can evoke through such visual elements as the font—meant to appear as if blown by a gentle breeze—and the use of photogravure and photopolymer printmaking processes in homage to the artwork of eighteenth-century naturalists. Chapters on natural phenomena such as “Wind,” “Fog,” and “Heat” focus on the impacts of weather on our everyday lives. In chapters on “War,” “Dominion,” and “Profit,” Redniss considers weather’s broader significance. It can play important roles in conferring power (as in the English’s defeat of the Spanish armada due to storms) and be used to scapegoat oppressed groups (as witch trials have shown). Today weather is at the center of intense debates concerning climate change. Redniss’s unique approach to visual storytelling enriches the ways in which stories can be conveyed, experienced, and understood.

	Lene Hau is an optical physicist whose research expands our capacity to control light. Hau has shown how it is possible, under precise experimental control, to extend the time it takes for photons to pass through certain materials. She stimulates small clouds of ultracold gas (Bose-Einstein condensates) with finely tuned lasers, so that light passing through them perpendicular to the laser beam, slows to a crawl. Using a technique she codeveloped (electromagnetically-induced transparency), Hau has been able to stop light completely and then release it under experimental control. Her experiments provide a proof-of-concept for the development of optical switches that preserve the quantum state of photons passing through them. Such switches may become an invaluable component of future computers that use quantum physics to perform calculations.

	She is at the forefront of cultural poetics, a relatively new subdiscipline of classical studies that combines the methods of philology, new historicism, and cultural anthropology, and integrates the evidence of literary sources and material culture. In her first book, The Traffic in Praise (1991), she interprets Pindar’s poetry within the socio-economic context of ancient Greece, illuminating the connections among poems, the role of the poet in society, and the role of the aristocracy in the early-fifth century. Kurke’s book, Coins, Bodies, Games, and Gold: The Politics of Meaning in Archaic Greece (1999) continues her analyses of the socioeconomic and ideological foundations of ancient Greek poetry. In this work, she demonstrates that the Greeks’ use of precious metals and money reveals much about their concepts of status, identity, and values. She is also the co-editor of Cultural Poetics in Archaic Greece: Cult, Performance, Politics (1998) and The Cultures within Ancient Greek Culture: Contact, Conflict, Collaboration (2003).

	About Lin's Work

	Lin He is a molecular biologist whose research has made pivotal contributions to an active, new avenue of cell biology: the role of microRNAs in the development of cancer. Her graduate training focused on the relationship between pigmentation genes and behavior and neuropathology. She and her colleagues identified a mouse gene mutation, mahoganoid, that exhibits age-dependent neural degeneration similar to prion diseases (e.g., mad cow disease) but without the degradation-resistant misfolded proteins characteristic of prion diseases. As a postdoctoral researcher, she shifted focus in an entirely new direction, working on microRNAs. Unlike messenger RNA, microRNAs are not translated into proteins. Lin He and colleagues established that a specific family of microRNAs, mi-34, plays an important role in the p53 tumor suppressor network, which works by blocking tumor cells from replicating or inducing their suicide. These findings are supported by the observation that many human tumors have chromosomal deletions that include the region where mi-34 RNAs are located. In independent research as a recent assistant professor, Lin He is working both to elucidate further the precise mechanism that each mi-34 subtype plays in the p53 pathway and to investigate the role of a different microRNA, mir17-92, in the development of B cell lymphomas. In an area that has generated intense effort among many leading researchers, Lin He has established early in her career the capacity to make significant advances with direct implications for the development of future cancer treatment strategies.

	About Lin-Manuel's Work

	Lin-Manuel Miranda is a composer, lyricist, and performer reimagining American musical theater in works that fuse traditional storytelling with contemporary musical styles and voices. Well-versed in the structure and history of musical theater, Miranda expands its idiom with the aesthetic of popular culture and stories from individuals and communities new to Broadway stages.

	In the Heights (2007), which Miranda began to write while in college, is set in Manhattan’s Dominican district, Washington Heights, and expresses the pathos of an immigrant community losing its neighborhood to gentrification and its younger generation to assimilation and upward mobility. In the opening scene, Miranda showcases his linguistic dexterity in the character Usnavi (played by Miranda himself), who interweaves song, dance, and narration to introduce the other various characters. They, in turn, express themselves in musical styles ranging from hip-hop to salsa.

	Miranda continues to explore the dramatic potential of hip-hop in Hamilton (2015), in which he uses an urban soundscape to tell the story of Alexander Hamilton’s rise from an orphaned West Indian immigrant to America’s first Treasury Secretary. Miranda presents policy battles, love triangles, and duels through high velocity lyrics, replete with false and slant rhymes, that expand the range of both pop and Broadway music. The daring pairing of street culture with America’s founding narrative recalls the youthful, defiant spirit of the American Revolution, and cross-racial casting connects the present day to the diverse immigrant society of the thirteen rebel colonies. Melding a love of the musical with a pop culture sensibility, Miranda is expanding the conventions of mainstream theater and showcasing the cultural riches of the American urban panorama.

	About Linda's Work

	Linda Bierds is a poet of elegant historiographies and descriptive narration.

	Her attention to historical detail and to narratives of lyric description sets her work apart from the prevailing contemporary styles of poetry. In her volume of poetry, Ghost Trio (1994), Bierds examines the role that imagination plays in our lives by looking at three English families across three generations: the Darwins, Wedgwoods and Whitfields, who all lived in proximity during the eighteenth century. Their stories unfold in an associative rather than linear way as family members reflect on death or other times when life seems to pause symbolically. In another work, The Profile Makers (1997), she tells the story of a Civil War family photo session – her sense of alliteration and rhythm mirroring the early state of the art of photography and the disheveled state of the Union. Her other works of poetry include Heart and Perimeter (1991), Companions for the Slow Rowing (1991), The Seconds (2000), and First Hand (2005).

	About Linda's Work

	Linda Griffith is a biotechnologist who is shaping the frontiers of tissue engineering and synthetic regenerative technologies. Her early work focused on designing novel substrates for liver cell cultures to allow pharmacologists to test in vitro the efficacy and toxicity of many potential drugs. Griffith has designed several methods for fabricating scaffolds on which cultured cells can adhere and grow. An initial effort used linear polymer gels cross-linked by electron-beam radiation to form star-shaped structures. More recently, she developed a solid-phase method using L-lactic acid for precisely controlling the pore size and surface chemistry of three-dimensional substrates. Using this technique, she has explored the optimal conditions (e.g., pore size, growth media, cell density, fluid dynamics) necessary for liver cells to live and organize into physiologically functional units. With these results, Griffith is developing a powerful tool for exploring the normal function of the liver and the mechanisms of disease that attack it, offering the prospect of significant reduction in the need for future organ replacement or regeneration. Her latest experiments are expanding the use of 3-D scaffolds for growing other cell types, such as blood-forming cells; as with the liver culture studies, these experiments lay the groundwork for building in vitro models of toxicity and cancer metastasis. At the intersection of materials science, cell surface chemistry, physiology, and anatomy, Griffith is extending the limits of biomedical engineering and its applications for diagnosing disease and regenerating damaged organs.

	About Lisa's Work

	Lisa Cooper is a nationally and internationally recognized physician and public health researcher whose scholarship on clinical communication is improving medical outcomes for minorities in the United States. A Liberian raised outside of the U.S., she brings a unique perspective to American medical care. While most studies concerning the disparities in health care across race and gender have focused on socioeconomic causes, Cooper has identified the crucial role race, ethnicity, and gender play in the physician-patient relationship. In a landmark 1999 Journal of the American Medical Association paper, she found that minority patients perceived their physicians’ decision-making style as significantly less participatory than non-minorities. She also established a direct link between the propensity of physicians to involve patients in treatment decisions and the success of health care interventions. In response to these findings, Cooper has developed culturally tailored education programs designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and depression among African-Americans. Preliminary results indicate that when patients and physicians are trained in patient-centered communication skills, patients are more likely to keep scheduled appointments, take medications as prescribed, and adhere to diet and exercise regimens. Given the growing population in the U.S. of ethnically diverse consumers, Cooper’s analytical and clinical skills are key to enhancing the quality and delivery of medical care.

	About Lisa's Work

	Lisa Daugaard is a criminal justice reformer developing an alternative to standard drug law enforcement that improves policing, outcomes for individuals suspected of law violations, and public safety. A former public defender, Daugaard is skilled at seeing beyond individuals to the systemic problems that inhibit change. She is a primary architect of the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program in King County (Seattle, Washington), a program that replaces punitive policing policies with public health and harm reduction services that address the underlying causes leading to participation in the drug trade.

	LEAD diverts individuals suspected of low-level offenses related to behavioral health problems or extreme poverty from the criminal justice system into social services such as housing, health care, job training, drug treatment, and mental health support. The program requires a cultural transformation for law enforcement, asking that police and prosecutors serve as frontline partners in public health. At the time of an arrest, police officers screen the suspected offenders for eligibility for LEAD. If eligible, the individuals do not undergo standard jail booking and criminal prosecution; instead, they are referred to a LEAD case manager, who completes an intake assessment that evaluates an individual’s substance-use frequency and treatment, time spent in housing, quality of life, psychological symptoms, interpersonal relationships, and health status. LEAD participants then receive low-barrier, harm-reduction-style case management in which the case managers engage with participants in their communities and connect them with existing resources. LEAD also assists with other pending criminal cases that participants have in local courts and with civil legal problems.

	LEAD’s successful launch in Seattle is a testimony to Daugaard’s skills as a coalition builder, but its expansion nationwide is a result of its achievement of measurable outcomes at relatively low cost per participant, including reduced recidivism and higher likelihood of employment and permanent housing. As director of the Public Defender Association (PDA), Daugaard is supporting the adaptation of the Seattle LEAD model to other localities through PDA’s LEAD National Support Bureau, including New Orleans, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Honolulu, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Albany (New York), Charleston (West Virginia), and several Native American tribes. Daugaard is pioneering approaches to the growing problem of substance abuse with the goal of protecting communities, improving public health, and saving lives.

	Quote from Lisa

	As our nation struggles with what comes after the era of mass incarceration, some of the alternatives being offered are too shallow to hold the weight of public expectations and individual needs. Though over-criminalization did tremendous harm, it's not enough just to stop that -- we must actually create ways to respond well to deeply felt needs for safety, order and health. Our small team, working with partners around the country, is feeling our way toward better answers that have the potential to endure, heal, and foster reconciliation.

	About Lisa's Work 

	Lisa Parks is a media scholar exploring the global reach of information technology infrastructures­—such as satellites, internet cables, power poles, and drones—and their cultural, political, and humanitarian implications. Her research concerns both the material and immaterial forces underlying the flow of information and the multilayered relationships between media, technology, and geopolitics.

	Parks’ first book, Cultures in Orbit: Satellites and the Televisual (2005), is a groundbreaking analysis of satellite use, including live international transmissions, archeological excavations via remote sensing, and satellite images documenting mass graves in Srebrenica during the Bosnian conflict. She demonstrates how satellites, as both a means of entertainment and surveillance, are deeply enmeshed with state and national power relations and can have a lasting impact on how people and places are perceived and categorized. In Rethinking Media Coverage: Vertical Mediation and the War on Terror (2018), she develops the concept of vertical mediation—the space above the surface of the Earth occupied by satellites, airwaves, drones, and other communications technology. Although inaccessible and imperceptible, Parks describes this vertical space as a new geography of the public sphere. These technologies can profoundly modify behavior on the ground, from enabling our most mundane activities, such as withdrawing cash from an ATM, to the threat of targeted killings facilitated by military drones equipped with infrared sensors.

	Parks has also investigated the consequences of widespread adoption of wireless communications and disparities in the material supports and structures that make up mass communication systems. In Zambia, for example, she has shown how online access is balanced alongside scarce survival resources such as water and energy, which are needed to sustain internet infrastructure. Parks is extending the parameters of media studies and revealing the ways in which media technologies have come increasingly to define our everyday lives, politics, and culture.

	About Livia's Work 

	Livia Eberlin is an analytical chemist developing innovative mass spectrometry technologies for more efficient and accurate clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment of cancer. Evaluation of tumor margins—that is, determining the boundary between cancerous and healthy tissue—is a critical problem in cancer surgery, particularly for brain tumors where keeping as much healthy tissue intact as possible significantly impacts the patient’s future quality of life. The traditional approach to margin evaluation is microscopic analysis of biopsied tissue, a process that prolongs surgery times or requires waiting several days for test results.

	Using a multidisciplinary approach bridging analytical chemistry, machine learning, engineering, clinical diagnostics, and surgical practice, Eberlin is developing ambient mass spectrometry–based imaging methodologies and instrumentation for the immediate, in situ chemical analysis of tissues. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a method for analyzing the chemical composition of matter by separating ionized (positively or negatively charged) molecules based on their mass-to-charge ratio in an electric field. Ambient MS imaging enables detection of the spatial distribution of molecules in a given sample under ambient conditions (that is, at atmospheric pressure and room temperature). Eberlin has optimized ambient MS imaging for detection of new molecular markers of diseased tissue, including abnormal expression and composition of mitochondrial lipids and distribution of proteins.

	She and collaborators have harnessed this technology for clinical applications in the MasSpec Pen. The MasSpec Pen extracts biomolecules from cancerous and surrounding normal tissues without destroying the living tissue.  These biomolecules are then analyzed using mass spectrometry and the tissue is characterized using a machine learning algorithm based on previously validated diagnostic data. This platform identifies cancerous tissue with a high degree of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and speed, and Eberlin is currently refining and testing the MasSpec Pen for use in surgery. Her technological innovations have the potential to improve health care by decreasing the time between diagnosis to treatment and increasing the accuracy of cancer diagnoses and surgical interventions.

	About Liza's Work

	Liza Lou is a young artist who creates luminous, colorful installation works that merge fine art and craft. Through years of long and meticulous labor, using hundreds of thousands of glass beads, Lou creates large-scale environmental works that turn familiar scenes into breathtaking spectacles of color and complexity. In creating her sculpture, she uses papier-mâché, fiberglass resin, wood, found materials, acrylic paint, and glass beads. Inspired by the mosaics in Italy’s basilicas, Lou spent five years creating her first major work, “Kitchen” (1995). This installation is a three-dimensional, life-size, 168-square-foot replica of a typical American kitchen of the 1950s. It includes a kitchen sink, a cherry pie cooling on an oven rack, and dust balls under the refrigerator, all entirely covered in brightly colored beads. In 1997, she created a bead-encrusted environment, “Back Yard,” covering 528 square feet and containing 250,000 blades of beaded grass in varying shades of green and yellow. Her bead installations are at once stunning works of art and commentary on popular American culture—suburban life and its materialism. With each work, Lou reconfigures elements of day-to-day life, creating easily recognized representations while obliging the viewer to reconsider these items from a fresh perspective.

	About Loren's Work

	Loren Rieseberg is a botanist who uses research on sunflowers to address the oldest and most vexing problem in evolutionary biology—how species originate. One longstanding debate is whether geographic isolation is required for speciation, and if not, how new species occupying a single territory (“sympatric”) can become both viable and reproductively isolated from parent species. Rieseberg was able to show that one sunflower species, Helianthus anomalus, results from an ancient natural hybridization of two other older species. Remarkably, Rieseberg has been able to replicate this hybridization under controlled conditions, in effect, reproducibly reenacting the creation of a new species. These results suggest that some factor intrinsic to the chromosomal structure of the sunflower facilitates a recombination process, leading to viable, reproductively isolated sympatric species. His genetic mapping studies support this hypothesis, and similar reports of others in different species indicate that hybridization-induced chromosomal rearrangement may be a widespread phenomenon. Throughout his work, Rieseberg applies a full range of theoretical and experimental approaches, from classical crossing experiments to contemporary molecular biologic techniques, to answer key questions of evolutionary genetics.

	About Lorenz's Work

	Lorenz Studer is a stem cell biologist pioneering the large-scale generation of dopaminergic neurons for transplantation, a breakthrough that could provide treatment for Parkinson’s disease and, eventually, other neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson’s, caused by the death of dopamine-generating cells in the brain, affects half a million people in the United States and up to five million worldwide. At present, there is no cure.

	Studer devised novel protocols for the transition of human pluripotent stem cells into neural and neural crest tissues and for the production of functional, stable dopaminergic neurons in large quantities. Previous attempts to create dopamine-generating neurons were not effective in terms of quantity or quality; the yield was too low for scalability and the neurons that were produced did not function properly, died after transplantation, or proliferated (which could cause tumors). In long-term studies, Studer demonstrated that the cells produced by his method are able to integrate into the brain, function effectively as the substantia nigra neurons that die in Parkinson’s disease, and do not proliferate. When transplanted into animal models, Parkinsonian symptoms significantly improved, giving hope for this replacement therapy as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease in humans.

	Studer has also contributed to our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases relating to aging. He established a protocol that uses progerin to age induced pluripotent cells (or pluripotent stem cells generated from adult cells), providing more reliable models of how cells behave in age-related disease. Studer is currently initiating clinical trials for transplantation of dopaminergic neurons for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, and his ground-breaking research is advancing the broader feasibility of stem cell–based therapies for neurological disorders.

	About Lu's Work

	Lu Chen is a neuroscientist who is probing the mysteries of the synapse, the anatomical structure that mediates chemical signals sent from one neuron to another. Specifically, she explores the mechanisms underlying the function of synapses that use the neurotransmitter glutamate (the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system). This transmitter interacts with postsynaptic neurons with several different types of receptors: kainate, NMDA, and AMPA. Studies of a genetically mutated mouse strain showed that AMPA receptor function is disrupted by the lack of stargazin, a protein homologous with a subunit of the calcium channel. Through a combination of molecular genetic, cell biology, biochemical, and electrophysiologic approaches, Chen and her colleagues were able to demonstrate that stargazin plays a key role in the structural integrity of the AMPA receptor complex. Chen created a line of non-neuronal cells that express each of the AMPA receptor components; in co-culture with hippocampal neurons, she showed that the neurons induced the formation of functional AMPA receptors in the non-neuronal cell line, and that stargazin represents an essential element of the receptor assembly. This observation opens a new avenue for exploring the role of accessory proteins in synaptic formation and plasticity. The potential impact is tremendous not just for understanding the basic biology of learning and memory, but also in the development of new kinds of treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

	About Luis' Work

	Luis von Ahn is a young computer scientist working at the intersection of cryptography, artificial intelligence, and natural intelligence to address problems of profound theoretical and practical importance. One line of his work focuses on a subdiscipline of cryptography known as steganography; unlike standard encrypted communications, a steganographic message disguises the fact that it contains a secret. (The prototypical example is a text message subtly embedded in the bits that encode a digital photograph.) Von Ahn developed a series of protocols that allow steganographic messages to exchange secure public keys. Recently, he expanded the notion of secure two-party computations by developing a method by which one party cannot detect whether the other party has even attempted to decode a message. Another major thread of his research concentrates on human computation that currently cannot be emulated by computers. He and his colleagues developed a method for distorting text in a way that remains easily readable by humans, but cannot be parsed by computers; this system, known as “CAPTCHA,” has found widespread application on commercial web sites. Von Ahn has also developed two web-based interactive games that convert otherwise dull, image-labeling tasks into competitive games. Not only do these sites provide an immediate improvement in the quality of information on the internet, but they also provide a rich database for exploring human visual cognition and developing computer algorithms to emulate it. While devising a range of imaginative and broadly applicable security solutions and other interactive systems, von Ahn is tackling ever more challenging questions at the frontiers of computer science.

Her most recent book, Samuel Johnson Is Indignant, consists of fifty-seven literary miniatures, each exemplifying her economical renderings of our most ordinary thoughts and moments. For Davis, restraint represents a platform for taking risks; she dares readers to puzzle over the highly experimental choices in form she employs – a letter of complaint to a funeral parlor, a hymn transcribed as a handwriting exercise, an interview regarding jury duty, and a single, fragmentary clause. Eschewing the conventions of plot, character, and drama, Davis shows how language itself can entertain, how all that what one word says, and leaves unsaid, can hold a reader’s interest. By enlarging both experiences and the nuances of plain language, Davis grants readers a glimpse of life’s previously invisible details, revealing new sources of philosophical insight and beauty.

	About Lynda's Work

	Lynda Barry is an educator, cartoonist, and graphic novelist unleashing the creative powers in others through a teaching practice centered on image making and writing. Barry is well known for her decades-long career as a cartoonist and graphic novelist. In “Ernie Pook’s Comeek,” her weekly comic strip in alternative newspapers, and graphic novels such as The Good Times Are Killing Me (1988) and One! Hundred! Demons! (2002), she broadened the psychological dimensions of the format and demonstrated an uncanny capacity to depict the intense emotions of adolescence. Over the past several years, Barry has turned her focus to education and enabling others to discover their own creativity.

	In her “Writing the Unthinkable” workshops, she leads students through exercises that emphasize the physical process of writing and drawing, often under time pressure, to stimulate creative thinking: examples of the exercises include drawing a three-minute self-portrait on an index card; keeping a five-minute daily diary of remembered observations from the previous day; filling sixteen frames with specific images, such as faces, while listening to poetry or music. Barry believes that art provides an alternate lens through which to view ideas and can play an important role in all levels of education. Her Drawbridge program pairs graduate students with four-year-old children in exploration of a topic (such as the difference between the mind and brain), giving graduate students new insight into their research problems as they are forced to use a visual approach, rather than words, to explain them.

	In addition to workshops and prolific social media engagement, Barry has shared her teaching approach in a number of publications. What It Is (2008) and Picture This (2010) are playful, interactive workbooks that combine prose with illustrations, incorporating collage, doodles, and handwriting layered onto yellow legal paper. The activity prompts and questions that follow encourage authentic expression and enhanced self-awareness through writing, drawing, thinking, and listening. Her follow-up publication, Syllabus (2014), is a collection of illustrated syllabi that guides the reader through a deliberate practice aimed at discovering novel ways of communicating ideas. Exuberant and generous as a teacher, Barry is removing the barriers that usually prevent people from writing and drawing and enabling artists and non-artists alike to take creative risks.

Her more recent works, Intimate Apparel and Fabulation, are considered to be her most accomplished thus far and represent major artistic achievements. Intimate Apparel, a prize-winning drama, is the story of a young black seamstress in early 20th-century New York, a woman working her way through the social confines of her time — predicaments that continue to haunt us today. Nottage’s imaginative exploration of history, her ability to find resonance in unexpected moments in the past, and her sensitive evocation of social concerns have made her a powerful voice in theater.

	Lynsey Addario is a photojournalist whose powerful images are visual testimony to the most pressing conflicts and humanitarian crises of the 21st century. In a time when many readers are becoming numb to the constant flow of images of war, death, and suffering, Addario combines a rigorous journalistic approach with a keen artistic eye to render events in Afghanistan, Darfur, Iraq, and elsewhere in startling and unexpected ways. Her vibrant color photographs of refugee camps in Darfur reveal both the cruelties that have been perpetrated as well as the dignity and humanity of the victims. Relentless in her pursuit of images that evoke an overall narrative, she has gained access to regions and peoples often closed to outsiders. Free of a singular didactic perspective, her photographic essays from Afghanistan and Iraq depict the underlying realities of war: the pain, confusion, and exhilaration of being a soldier; the daily struggles for civilians, especially children, living in a war zone; and the lives of Taliban leaders. A regular theme in Addario’s work is capturing the lives of women in male-dominated societies. Her most recent project involves photographing survivors of gender-based violence in the Congo and is part of a traveling exhibition intended to increase awareness of the ongoing human rights abuses taking place there. Addario’s dedication to demystifying foreign cultures and exposing the tragic consequences of human conflict is drawing much-needed attention to conflict zones around the world and providing a valuable historical record for future generations.

	About Maggie's Work

	Maggie Nelson is a writer forging a new mode of nonfiction that transcends the divide between the personal and the intellectual and renders pressing issues of our time into portraits of day-to-day lived experience. Nelson’s five book-length works of nonfiction are grounded in experiences and topics with which she is struggling. She invites the reader into her process of thinking through and making sense of her unique concerns with the help of feminist and queer theory, cultural and art criticism, philosophy and psychology.

	The trial of the suspected murderer of her aunt serves as the jumping off point for Nelson’s exploration of sexual violence and media spectacle in The Red Parts (2007). In The Art of Cruelty (2011), she mines the thinking of Antonin Artaud, Hannah Arendt, Susan Sontag, and other art and literary critics in her consideration of the aesthetic use of cruelty that characterizes much of twentieth-century avant-garde art. Raw emotion and the needs, habits, and desires of the body drive Bluets (2009)—a philosophical meditation on the color blue, the end of a relationship, and a friend’s grievous injury—and The Argonauts (2015), in which Nelson recounts her transition into motherhood and the evolution of her relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. She weighs her experience—physical, emotional, and intellectual—of creating queer family against and through the work of philosophers, linguists, feminist and queer theorists, developmental psychologists, artists, and cultural critics.

	In all of her work, Nelson remains skeptical of truisms and ideologies and continually challenges herself to consider multiple perspectives. Her empathetic and open-ended way of thinking—her willingness to change her mind and even embrace qualities of two seemingly incompatible positions—offers a powerful example for how very different people can think and live together. Through the dynamic interplay between personal experience and critical theory, Nelson is broadening the scope of nonfiction writing while also offering compelling meditations on social and cultural questions.

	About Majora's Work

	Majora Carter, of the South Bronx, is determined to make her community more livable, greener, and healthier than it is today. The founder and director of Sustainable South Bronx (SSB), Carter is a relentless and charismatic urban strategist who seeks to address the disproportionate environmental and public health burdens experienced by residents of the South Bronx. Working in partnership with local government, businesses, and neighborhood organizations, she creates new opportunities for transportation, fitness and recreation, nutrition, and economic development. Returning to her native Hunts Point section of the South Bronx after completing an MFA, Carter first sought to deepen the emphasis on the arts in the South Bronx. It wasn’t long, however, before she was engaged in battle over New York City’s plan for a solid waste management plant to process 40 percent of the city’s garbage at a facility on the Hunts Point waterfront. Successfully diverting this plan, SSB and other groups envisioned a new relationship with the Bronx River and embarked on projects that built a park on the site of a former concrete plant, enabled public waterfront access where the shore was once littered with industrial scrap, developed an ecological restoration workforce to protect and maintain the natural environment, and raised funds to conduct a feasibility study for the establishment of a bike/pedestrian greenway along the waterfront. Making the connection between green space and health, Carter added a community education focus to the work of the SSB around fitness, food choices, and air quality. As part of this effort, she established a community market and introduced green roof technology. Today, Majora Carter is profoundly transforming the quality of life for South Bronx residents.

	About Maneesh's Work

	Maneesh Agrawala is a computer scientist designing visual interfaces that enhance our ability to understand large quantities of complex information. Working at the intersection of visualization, human-computer interaction, and computer graphics, Agrawala draws on cognitive psychology to identify the key perceptual and design principles underlying graphic illustrations. His algorithms automatically generate legible and effective designs for a variety of data types. As a graduate student, Agrawala developed LineDrive, a fully automated system for rendering route maps that both takes into account myriad cognitive factors involved in a user’s navigation of routes and adapts cartographic techniques for emphasizing essential information. The resulting maps resemble hand-drawn sketches in which unnecessary details are simplified or omitted and a larger scale is used at key locations to avoid confusion. Agrawala also developed a system that generates accurate and intelligible step-by-step assembly instructions for everyday items as well as complex machines (e.g., aircraft engines). The system utilizes exploded views — so that individual components of the object are spatially separated — in order to provide the user with a more direct understanding of the actual steps required for assembly. Agrawala and colleagues subsequently expanded on this work to create a program that produces illustrations of complex, three-dimensional objects, such as anatomical models. The program includes an interface that allows users to explore the spatial relationships among components by isolating parts of an object to magnify, expand, or collapse. Agrawala’s novel approach to visualization and computer communication in these and many other projects is transforming how we use, synthesize, and comprehend the ever-increasing volume of digital information we encounter in our daily lives.

	About Manu's Work

	Manu Prakash is a physical biologist applying his expertise in soft-matter physics to illuminate often easy to observe but hard to explain phenomena in biological and physical contexts and to invent solutions to difficult problems in global health, science education, and ecological surveillance. His many lines of research are driven by curiosity about the diversity of life forms on our planet and how they work, empathy for problems in resource-poor settings, and a deep interest in democratizing the experience and joy of science globally.

	Prakash’s projects range from explorations of how shorebirds drink to how a few drops of food coloring can demonstrate highly complex behavior such as chemotaxis, akin to active living matter. His early training and research focused on ideas of physical computation, with a goal of building new computational engines capable of manipulating not just bits of information but also physical matter. One such demonstration involved building a computer out of tiny air bubbles traveling in microfluidic channels. In recent work, Prakash demonstrated a practical implementation of this “water computer,” or microfluidic processor, with potential applications in diagnostics and environmental monitoring.

	More recently, Prakash has channeled his ingenuity to invent several devices that empower frugal science: these are low-cost, widely accessible, and appropriate for use in low-resource and field settings. Foldscope, a lightweight optical microscope that costs less than a dollar to produce, is assembled from an origami-based folding design from a single sheet of paper with integrated lenses and electronics. With submicron resolution, Foldscope has already been widely embraced in educational contexts. Prakash has enlisted thousands of volunteers—from medical experts to citizen scientists—to field test Foldscope as he works to refine it for use in public health and biomedical settings. Another recent project is a low-cost, sticker-like microfluidic chip that can collect thousands of nanoliter-volume droplets of saliva from mosquito bites that can be screened for pathogens. The chip would enable rapid, scalable, and low-cost collection of surveillance data that is critical for predicting and controlling mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. With remarkable breadth and imagination, Prakash defies traditional disciplinary boundaries in his coupling of basic research and fabrication of high-capability scientific instruments for widespread use in the field and classroom.

	About Marc's Work

	Marc Edwards, a civil engineer, is playing a vital role in ensuring the safety of drinking water and in exposing deteriorating water-delivery infrastructure in America’s largest cities. An expert in the chemistry and toxicity of urban water supplies in the United States, he has made significant advancements in a broad array of areas, including arsenic removal, coagulation of natural organic material, and the causes and control of copper and lead corrosion in new and aging distribution systems. Melding rigorous science, concern for public safety, and dogged investigation, Edwards’ recent work focused on the identification and analysis of lead contamination in the Washington, D.C. area’s local water supply. In this research, he made the startling discovery that the addition of chloramine disinfectant (a new and widely used replacement for chlorine) in tap water actually increased the incidence of lead leaching in residential and commercial aqueducts, in many cases above acceptable EPA limits. He went on to link several cases of lead poisoning, earlier thought to be caused by lead paint, to local tap water. His findings also revealed systemic weaknesses in the regional water testing program, prompting the Washington Area Water Authority to replace lead service lines throughout the district. Now expanding his focus to other cities, he is defining new and more effective ways to test local water and predict the risk of chemical contamination in urban infrastructure. Through his exhaustive research efforts, Edwards is making critical contributions to the health of individuals and communities throughout the U.S. in an often-neglected area of domestic public safety.

	About Margaret's Work

	Margaret Stock is an attorney bringing her singular knowledge of immigration law and national security law to bear on reform efforts through direct representation and policy-based advocacy. With a broad view of national security that goes beyond protecting the country from terrorist threats to include the protection of economic and political interests that ensure our prosperity, Stock articulates the crucial role of a healthy and efficient immigration system in responding to changes in the global economy and maintaining the foundational values of our democracy.

	Stock’s experiences serving in the U.S. Army Reserve and teaching at West Point have led her to focus much of her work to date on the impact of immigration law on military personnel and their families. She has spearheaded the development of three groundbreaking programs that creatively adapt existing laws to better the lives of both immigrants and native-born military personnel. Beginning in 2008, she initiated and, in cooperation with the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, implemented the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program, which allows the U.S. armed forces to attract and retain foreign nationals with language, medical, and other skills critical to military readiness and national security by expediting their path to citizenship.

	Having seen firsthand the plight of limited-income military families in dire need of legal assistance, she created the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) MAP program, which pairs volunteer attorneys across the United States with those in need of their services. She also prompted the Naturalization at Basic Training Initiative, an intergovernmental program designed to promote and expedite the naturalization of military personnel by reducing processing times and providing naturalization ceremonies at basic training locations.

	Through these programs, her written scholarship, and her contributions to policy debates (including as an expert witness before Congress), Stock is challenging our complex immigration laws in order to provide more humane and rational policies that will also serve American national security interests.

	About Maria's Work

	Maria Chudnovsky is a mathematician who investigates the fundamental principles of graph theory. In mathematics, a graph is an abstraction that represents a set of similar things and the connections between them—e.g., cities and the roads connecting them, networks of friendship among people, web sites and their links to other sites. When used to solve real-world problems, like efficient scheduling for an airline or package delivery service, graphs are usually so complex that it is not possible to determine whether testing all the possibilities individually will find the best solution in a practical time period. Chudnovsky explores classifications and properties of graphs that can serve as shortcuts to brute-force methods; showing that a specific graph belongs to a certain class often implies that it can be calculated relatively quickly. In an early breakthrough, Chudnovsky and colleagues proved a conjecture offered in the early 1960s, known as the “Strong Perfect Graph Theorem,” that identifies specific criteria required for a graph to fall into the “perfect” class. Any perfect graph can be colored efficiently (i.e., no node is connected to another node of the same color), and graph coloring bears a direct relation to finding efficient solutions to problems such as allocating non-interfering radio frequencies in communication networks. Since this landmark accomplishment, Chudnovsky has continued to generate a series of important results in graph theory. Although her research is highly abstract, she is laying the conceptual foundations for deepening the connections between graph theory and other major branches of mathematics, such as linear programming, geometry, and complexity theory.

	About Maria's Work

	Maria Mavroudi is a philologist who uses her skills as a language detective to reveal a new understanding of the linguistic and cultural exchanges between medieval Byzantium and its Islamic Middle Eastern neighbors. Most scholarship on Greco-Arabic interaction has focused on the “one-way” transmission of classical Greek thought into the Islamic world. Through her meticulous analysis of The Oneiroticon of Achmet, the most significant medieval Byzantine treatise on dream interpretation (a proto-science of the time akin to astrology, astronomy, and alchemy), Mavroudi traces intellectual currents flowing from the Arabic world into Byzantine culture and society. She shows that the Oneiroticon is a Christianized adaptation of medieval Arabic texts, which, in turn, are based on the classical Greek Oneiroticon of Artemidoros (second century A.D.). The implications of her work are profound; her research on this text provides clear evidence that significant importation of Arabic learning into Byzantium occurred and that Greek-Arabic bilingualism developed to facilitate such exchanges between two otherwise antagonistic cultures.

	About Marie-Therese's Work

	Marie-Therese Connolly is a lawyer who draws on a blend of legal, policy, and legislative skills to combat the largely hidden but immense problem of elder abuse and mistreatment. She has devoted her career to laying bare the many forms of elder abuse: physical and psychological, as well as financial exploitation and wrongful deprivation of rights. Some estimates suggest there are 5 million victims of elder abuse each year in the United States and as high as 96 percent of these cases go unreported, numbers that are sure to increase as 77 million baby boomers age and caregiving shortages grow more acute. As director of the Department of Justice's Elder Justice and Nursing Home Initiative, Connolly developed new legal theories of liability and novel investigation and litigation strategies that overcame loopholes in federal statutes and led to successful prosecution of cases of abuse and neglect in nursing homes. Recognizing that the vast human and economic costs of elder abuse cannot be solved by prosecutions alone, Connolly was instrumental in the drafting and passage of the Elder Justice Act, the first piece of federal legislation to address the issue specifically. She worked tirelessly to bring together various stakeholders in the heretofore fragmented elder justice field — including researchers, law enforcement officials, social workers, advocates, legislators, and clinicians — to identify gaps in current legislation and develop a comprehensive policy strategy. She is continuing this work as founder and director of the Life Long Justice initiative, where she is creating an integrated national advocacy effort to prevent, detect, and intervene in the mistreatment of the elderly and secure reauthorization of key federal legislation. Currently writing for general audiences about the complex issues surrounding abuse and neglect, Connolly is a leading voice in efforts to prevent the suffering of older adults and ensure that elder abuse becomes a priority on the national agenda.

	About Marin's Work

	Marin Soljačić is a young theoretical physicist whose work on several aspects of electromagnetic waves holds important implications for understanding fundamental principles of optical physics and for development of devices such as switches for optical computers and wireless power transmitters. Soljačić has made several conceptual breakthroughs, each subsequently generating a wave of experiments. First, he analyzed the conditions under which optical fields can maintain their stability in optically non-linear media — so-called “Necklace Solitons.” Then he determined that sound waves propagating through linear photonic crystals can exert profound effects on the frequency of light passing through the crystals, even though the speed of the sound waves is many orders of magnitude slower than the speed of the light. More recently, he invented a single photon optical switch, proving that when an object having electromagnetically induced transparency (e.g., in a specially prepared Bose-Einstein condensate) is placed within a photonic crystal, a single photon can determine whether it will transmit or reflect a light beam passing perpendicularly through the wave guide. Such a switch in an optical computer is a major breakthrough and is analogous to the transistor in contemporary microprocessors. In July 2007, he published a paper that revisited an idea of Nikola Tesla that electrical power can be transmitted wirelessly. Though radiative power transfer of the sort Tesla envisioned is impractical, Soljačić demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that strongly coupled magnetic resonances can wirelessly transfer 60 watts of power over 2 meters with reasonable efficiency and low electrical field emissions. This method of wireless power transmission may someday lead to devices in homes, offices, and hospitals that use significant amounts of power without requiring batteries or wall-socket connections. Though still early in his career, Soljačić has demonstrated in multiple contexts how his approach to theoretical optical physics generates important implications for experimental research and for the development of new technologies.

	About Marina's Work

	Marina Rustow is a historian using the Cairo Geniza texts to shed new light on Jewish life and on the broader society of the medieval Middle East. The Cairo Geniza (or Genizah) comprises hundreds of thousands of legal documents, letters, and literary materials—many of them fragmentary—deposited in Cairo’s Ben Ezra Synagogue over more than a millennium. Rustow’s approach to this archive goes beyond decoding documents, in itself a formidable task, to questioning the relationship between subjects and medieval states and asking what that relationship tells us about power and the negotiation of religious boundaries.

	In Heresy and the Politics of Community: The Jews of the Fatimid Caliphate (2008), Rustow focuses on the period from 909 to 1171 C.E. and upends long-accepted ideas about the relationship between two rival Jewish communities under Fatimid rule. Prior historians, basing their interpretation on literary polemics, had depicted the Rabbanites and Karaites (or Qaraites) of Egypt and Syria as factions bitterly divided by theological difference, the latter branded as heretics and marginalized. Rustow examined nonliterary Geniza documents (such as letters, legal contracts, and state petitions and decrees) and revealed a wealth of social, economic, and political transactions between the two groups. The finding calls into question the depth of the religious schism, suggesting a higher level of tolerance and cooperation than had been assumed.

	Rustow’s current work addresses Geniza documents in Arabic script from the Fatimid caliphate. Using a bidirectional lens—that is, interpreting the material from the point of view of both the Islamic and Jewish communities—Rustow is mining these documents for what they can tell us about how the caliphal state ruled and how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim subjects related to it. In a current collaborative project, Rustow is developing a handbook of medieval legal and state documents from the Middle East never before published or accessible in archives. Deploying her considerable prowess in languages, social history, and papyrology, Rustow is rewriting our understanding of medieval Jewish life and transforming the historical study of the Fatimid empire.

	About Mark's Work

	Mark Bradford is an artist who incorporates ephemera from urban environments into mixed-media works on canvas that are rich in texture and visual complexity. Though he has experimented throughout his career with many different artistic media, including public art, installations, and video, his signature and best-known work takes the form of massively scaled, abstract collages that he assembles out of signage and other materials collected, most frequently, from his own neighborhood in South Central Los Angeles. Bradford’s aesthetic language makes use of such elements as bits of billboards, handmade advertisements, foil, string, and permanent wave end-papers from beauty shops, which he arranges, layers, singes, sands, and bleaches into brilliantly hued, painterly structures that appear to sprawl and swirl. Loosely gridded and often cartographic in character, these pieces both reflect his interest in the formal traditions of modernist abstraction and reference the communities from which he culls his materials. Glimpses of partially legible text and imagery within his map-like works evoke a multitude of metaphors and suggest intricate systems in a constant state of flux. In the multilayered tableau Los Moscos (2004), bursts of bright yellows and reds radiate through a predominance of darker fragments, calling to mind clusters of pulsing city lights viewed from a collapsed and distanced perspective. With this piece and numerous others in his increasingly ambitious body of work, Bradford is developing a visually arresting means of representing in two dimensions the dynamism and depth of the sites and streets he excavates.

	About Mark's Work

	Mark Hersam is a materials scientist investigating the physical, chemical, and biological properties of nanomaterials with potential uses in a range of fields, including information technology, biotechnology, and energy. Taking an interdisciplinary approach that draws on techniques from materials science, physics, engineering, and chemistry, Hersam has established himself as a leading experimentalist in the area of hybrid organic-inorganic materials, with a focus on the study of the electrical and optical properties of carbon and related nanomaterials.

	Graphene, a single atomic layer of hexagonally bonded carbon atoms, and carbon nanotubes, rolled sheets of graphene in single or multiple layers, have long been recognized for their potential applications in electronics, photovoltaics, batteries, and bioimaging. A limiting factor, however, has been the inability to separate carbon nanotubes efficiently based on characteristics such as electronic type, diameter, or chirality. The electrical properties of these materials are dependent on their physical and electronic structure, but when synthesized by conventional methods the different types of tubes are inextricably mixed together. Hersam developed a scalable, tunable solution to carbon nanotube separation based on a traditional biological research technique known as density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU). Using this technique, Hersam is able to produce high-purity samples on a large scale, offering new promise for applied uses. For example, his lab recently demonstrated that semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes are promising candidates for next-generation electronics and photovoltaics.

	Hersam has also developed and used sophisticated scanning tunneling microscope systems for studying fundamental aspects of surface properties at the atomic scale, in particular how various molecules interact with graphene. A dedicated teacher in addition to being a highly productive researcher, Hersam’s versatility and interdisciplinary approach are leading to path-breaking discoveries in the exploration, synthesis, and application of novel electronic materials.

	About Mark's Work

	Mark Roth is a biomedical scientist whose pioneering research ranges from molecular mechanisms of genetic regulation to whole-animal physiology to medical diagnostics. In his early work on messenger RNA processing, he discovered a class of molecules known as SR proteins, which play a key role in stabilizing mRNA as it undergoes the post-transcriptional maturation process. He postulated that the structure of SR proteins made them ready targets for antibodies from patients with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE). Based on this hypothesis, Roth developed an important clinical assay for diagnosing SLE and obtained FDA approval for its use. More recently, Roth has established that conditions such as anoxia and chemicals such as carbon monoxide can, when carefully controlled, induce a reversible metabolic suspension (suspended animation) in some animals. He recently found, for example, that hydrogen sulfide gas can induce a state of suspended animation in mice that is reversible with no evidence of harm to the animals. This line of research offers the possibility of important new clinical strategies for treating trauma, stroke, cancer, and a host of other conditions where temporary reduction in metabolism would provide much-needed time for physicians to address underlying problems.

	About Markus' Work

	Markus Greiner is an experimental physicist who is advancing our capacity to control the spatial organization of ultra-cold atoms with the aim of revealing basic principles of condensed matter physics. The past twenty years have seen enormous strides in cooling atoms with evaporation and lasers to the point that their quantum behavior can be directly observed and controlled. As a student and postdoctoral fellow, Greiner participated in several seminal studies in this area. His current research program is taking this line of inquiry to the next step by designing an apparatus that can trap thousands of ultra-cold atoms in well-ordered 2-dimensional arrays, or lattices. Because ultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice behave much like electrons in a solid-state crystal, quantum phenomena like superconductivity can be investigated under conditions much better controlled than with complex crystals. Greiner recently created a quantum gas microscope that allows direct visualization of each individual atom within a 2D optical lattice. With this device, his team was able to simulate how solid-state crystals transition between insulating and superconducting states and investigate quantum magnets, two of many possible experimental applications for such a tool. Because optical lattices offer high-resolution control over the quantum state of hundreds or thousands of individual elements, they may also represent an important platform for investigating quantum computing or high-density information storage. Still early in his career, Greiner has already demonstrated the ability to develop techniques that open new avenues for exploration of physics and to apply these advances to both fundamental physics and technology.

	About Marla's Work

	Marla Spivak is an entomologist who is developing practical applications to protect honey bee populations from decimation by disease while making fundamental contributions to our understanding of bee biology. Essential to healthy ecosystems and to the agricultural industry as pollinators of a third of the United States’ food supply, honey bees have been disappearing at alarming rates in recent years due to the accumulated effects of parasitic mites, viral and bacterial diseases, and exposure to pesticides. To mitigate these threats, Spivak’s research focuses on genetically influenced behaviors that confer disease resistance to entire colonies through the social interactions of thousands of workers. Her studies of hygienic behavior—the ability of certain strains of bees to detect and remove infected pupae from their hives—have enabled her to breed more disease-resistant strains of bees for use throughout the beekeeping industry. Spivak’s “Minnesota Hygienic” line of bees offers an effective and more sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides in fighting a range of pests and pathogens, including the Varroa mite, a highly destructive parasite that spreads rapidly through Western honey bee colonies. By translating her scientific findings into accessible presentations, publications, and workshops, she is leading beekeepers throughout the United States to establish local breeding programs that increase the frequency of hygienic traits in the general bee population. With additional investigations into the antimicrobial effects of bee-collected plant resins under way, Spivak continues to explore additional methods for limiting disease transmission and improving the health of one of the world’s most important pollinators.

	Mary Halvorson is a guitarist, ensemble leader, and composer who is pushing against established musical categories with a singular sound on her instrument and an aesthetic that evolves with each new album and configuration of bandmates. She melds her jazz roots with elements of experimental rock, folk, and other musical traditions, reflecting a wide range of stylistic influences.

	Halvorson’s guitar playing is distinguished by her percussive picking style and the distinctive clarity of tone she produces on her vintage Guild hollow-body guitar, which she amplifies with subtle, pitch-bending electronic interventions. She is equally adept at picking out delicate and nuanced melodic lines and producing a spray of atmospheric noise. Over the past dozen years, she has performed solo and in settings ranging from intimate chamber jazz ensembles to genre-crossing groups of five, seven, and eight players. Her debut album as a bandleader, Dragon’s Head (2008), features her original compositions written for a trio of guitar, string bass, and drums. On Away with You (2016), she leads an octet that fluidly blends the timbres of a brass section with the dramatic effects of a pedal steel guitar, an instrument more frequently associated with country music than with jazz. For the ambitious double album Code Girl (2018), Halvorson composed both original music and lyrics for a quintet that includes her longtime, three-player collective, Thumbscrew, joined by a vocalist and trumpeter. Each track on the album showcases her interest in finding ever more imaginative ways to build intricate musical structures with ample space for improvisation and organic collaboration and to balance striking harmonies with moments of dissonance and distortion.

	A virtuosic performer and adventurous composer, Halvorson defies convention with her idiosyncratic, sonic explorations at the intersection of jazz and rock.

	About Mary's Work

	Mary Jackson is a fiber artist whose intricately coiled vessels preserve the centuries-old craft of sweetgrass basketry and push the tradition in stunning new directions. A descendent of the Gullah community of coastal South Carolina, Jackson learned to make baskets at the age of four from her mother and grandmother, who passed on skills brought to the United States by their West African ancestors. Developed originally as domestic and agricultural tools for cotton and rice production, sweetgrass baskets have traditionally taken such utilitarian shapes as storage containers and rice fanners. With masterful technique, Jackson translates these practical designs into finely detailed, sculptural forms. To maximize color contrasts, she incorporates other regional materials — strips of palmetto, long-leaf pine needles, and bulrush — into works that rise in rhythmic coils and demonstrate the remarkable strength and tension of her stitched constructions. Her innovations include the dramatically arched handle that complements the low, compact body of “Untitled with Handle” and the spray of unbound grass that spills from the lip of “Unfinished,” as if suspended in mid-assembly. Jackson is currently at work on a project of similarly bold and technically challenging proportions: an extremely shallow structure that spans five feet in diameter. As a founding member of the Mount Pleasant Sweetgrass Basket Makers’ Association, she also leads efforts to protect the threatened wetland habitats of sweetgrass and ensure continued local access to these resources. While preserving the culture and history of her ancestors, Jackson infuses this inherited art form with a contemporary aesthetic and expressiveness all her own.

	Biography

	Mary Jackson learned her family’s tradition of basketry at the age of four and has devoted herself full-time to this art form since the 1970s. Her work has been exhibited at numerous institutions throughout the United States, including the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Museum of African American History in Detroit.

	About Mary's Work 

	Mary L. Bonauto is a civil rights lawyer whose powerful arguments and long-term legal strategies have led to historic strides in the effort to achieve marriage equality for same-sex couples across the United States. The Civil Rights Project Director at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders(GLAD) since 1990, much of her early work focused on adoption and parenting, censorship, hate crimes, and discrimination in jobs and public accommodations.

	Mindful of the risks of loss and political backlash when social reform litigation advances ahead of public understanding, Bonauto and her GLAD colleagues initially pursued an incremental, state-based strategy to secure government marriage licenses for same-sex couples in the New England states. Bonauto and Vermont colleagues formed a critical partnership in 1997, which is widely acknowledged as a pivotal time and place to challenge a state’s exclusion of gay and lesbian couples from marriage. The Vermont Supreme Court’s ruling in Baker v. Vermont (1999) was the first to hold that same-sex couples must be provided all of the same protections and obligations provided to married couples, and the state legislature established the first civil union law in the nation in 2000 to comply with that ruling. GLAD’s subsequent filing of Goodridge v. Department of Public Health in Massachusetts, relying again on state constitutional guarantees of equality and liberty, resulted in the 2003 landmark decision that made that state the first to extend marriage equality to same-sex couples. Bonauto’s constitutional arguments in Goodridge articulated the breadth of the practical and social harms imposed by the state’s exclusion on real families and their children. In defending the marriage ruling from attempts to substitute civil unions, she drew on painful lessons from our nation’s past, most notably the history of unjust “separate but equal” doctrines as substitutes for racial and gender equality, and the Massachusetts high court was the first to reject civil unions as a substitute for marriage. The Goodridge ruling, the transformative effect of same-sex couples marrying on the public’s views, and subsequent legal (in Connecticut), legislative (in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire), and ballot-based (in Maine) victories all provided a solid foundation and roadmap for future strategies across the nation, including at the federal level.

	In 2009, Bonauto led a team from GLAD and private law firms in the first strategic challenge to section three of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and argued that the federal government’s non-recognition of the lawful and rapidly growing number of marriages unconstitutionally denied same-sex couples more than 1,000 federal protections and obligations usually available to married persons. Her case—Gill v. Office of Personnel Management—provided the first federal court wins in challenges to DOMA (in 2010 and 2012 rulings), and served as an important model for United States v. Windsor, the landmark case that ultimately resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court striking down DOMA in 2013 and on which she served as a strategist and external coordinator of friend-of-the-court briefs. In the name of equal treatment and dignity for all people, and in concert with other litigators and advocates across the country, Bonauto is breaking down legal barriers based on sexual orientation and influencing debates about the relationship between the law and momentous social change more broadly.

	About Mary's Work

	Mary Reid Kelley is an artist who makes arresting, playful, and erudite videos that explore the condition of women throughout history. Drawing on literary and historical material, the videos involve intensive research and critical reassessments of standard historical narratives. Reid Kelley is involved in every aspect of the videos’ creation—from writing the scripts (typically in highly structured poetic verse), to designing the sets, props, and costumes, to performing the leading roles—and all of the videos are produced by her and her partner, Patrick Kelley, at their private studio.

	The style of the works—which is informed by the crude, black and white figures of early animation and the lo-tech look of amateur film—lends visual force to her sardonic, critical view of the pacifying notion that progress has completed its work improving the standing of women in society. In You Make Me Iliad (2010), Reid Kelley plays the respective roles of a Belgian prostitute working near the frontlines during World War I and a male soldier with medical training who is charged with monitoring the brothels. In over one hundred rhymed couplets, densely packed with puns, literary allusions, double entendre, and other varieties of language play, Reid Kelley mockingly discloses the unbalanced power dynamics and confined gender roles of the sexual economies of World War I.

	A recent trilogy of films centers around the Greek myth of the minotaur, reimagined as half-woman, half-bull in the inaugural video, Priapus Agonistes (2013). The second of the series, Swinburne’s Pasiphae (2014), takes for its script an unpublished fragment by the Victorian poet Charles Algernon Swinburne. Reid Kelley luridly portrays Pasiphae’s aberrant lust for a white bull, which results in the conception of the minotaur. The juxtaposition of contemporary cultural references with classical and Victorian precedents uncannily reveals the stubborn endurance of sexual taboos and gender inequity across history. Reid Kelley is fusing together a variety of artistic approaches and traditions—from drawing and painting, sculpture and installation, to theater and cinema, performance and literary criticism—into a hybrid form of video that is like nothing else being produced today.

	About Mary's Work

	Mary Tinetti is a physician who has pioneered the study of a long-recognized, but previously little-investigated, public health problem in gerontology: morbidity due to falls by elderly people. Early in her career, Tinetti undertook efforts to deconstruct the prevailing notion of falls — “accidents” unavoidably associated with advanced age — to establish quantitative relationships between known risk factors and injury. In one study, Tinetti and her colleagues performed a controlled intervention that demonstrated for the first time that the frequency and severity of falls can be reduced significantly and that measured the efficacy of intervention against specific risk factors. She subsequently extended this work to take into account an elderly person’s living situation, whether at home or under various types of institutional care. More recently, she has championed the notion that injuries from falling (and increased risk of falling) should be reconceived as an integral part of the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients who suffer from comorbid diseases such as hypotension, diabetes, depression, arthritis, and insomnia. She has investigated the relationship among medicines to treat these conditions, over-the-counter medicines, and possible increased risk for falls with significant injury. Even with her prolific empirical research, Tinetti maintains a focus on the health of individual patients. For example, she has created a large-scale, interdisciplinary program in Connecticut that aims to prevent falling and reduce the effects of injuries by integrating fall prevention exercises into routine health care of older adults. With her multidimensional strategies, Tinetti is developing a more sophisticated approach for treating the elderly and pushing the field of geriatrics toward a comprehensive understanding of how the ailments of aging can accumulate in unexpected ways.

	About Matias's Work

	Matias Zaldarriaga is a theoretical astrophysicist who analyzes faint signatures of the Big Bang to piece together the early history of the cosmos. Early in his career, Zaldarriaga co-wrote computer software known as CMBFAST that has become a standard tool for astronomers interpreting observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB); it has been used to estimate the total density of mass and energy in the universe. His analyses reveal the power of CMB observations such as lensing and polarization to generate gravitational maps of the early universe and for exploring indirectly the properties of otherwise undetectable matter in the intervening space. Zaldarriaga is equally adept at identifying the interpretive pitfalls in analyzing experimental data; his insights have a direct impact on the design of telescopes that are currently being constructed. Recently, he and his colleagues have argued that the period after the Big Bang but before the formation of the first stars could be indirectly observed by examining variations in CMB at the 21 cm wavelength. This proposal may offer an experimental window into events that previously were only matters of conjecture. Though many of his studies are deeply rooted in observational astronomy, Zaldarriaga shows both a capacity and a propensity for integrating his results within a theoretical framework constructed on deep physical principles.

	About Matthew's Work 

	Matthew Aucoin is a composer expanding the potential of vocal and orchestral music to convey emotional, dramatic, and literary meaning. A talented pianist, writer, and conductor in addition to a composer, Aucoin melds sound and language to create musical works that vividly communicate the nuances, ambiguities, and multiple meanings of texts in musical form.

	In 2015, he premiered two original operatic works for which he wrote both the music and librettos. Crossing draws from Walt Whitman’s diary entries from his time tending wounded soldiers in the Civil War. The score adapts various modernist and neoclassical styles, intertwining lyrical passages and frenetic energy reminiscent of techno. More than narrating scenes from the life of the poet, the music and libretto together create a portrait of Whitman’s emotional conflict after an encounter with another man while also dramatizing a defining feature of his work: the inherent contradictions of the self. Aucoin’s opera for young people, Second Nature, is set in the future in a world suffering the effects of pollution and climate change. The piece engages young audiences through the topical and challenging subject matter without sacrificing musical and theatrical sophistication.

	Aucoin also composes instrumental works, ranging from pieces for solo performers to compositions for chorus and orchestra, often relating and constructing sounds to articulate specific concepts or ideas. Finery Forge (2017), a piece for two pianos, is a musical representation of the process of refining metal, with g-sharp minor chords evoking crude iron ore and the pianos’ overtones corresponding to flying sparks of molten metal. Through his own works and active exploration of collaborations across artistic genres, Aucoin is quickly becoming a vital creative force in the American musical landscape.

	About Matthew's Work

	Matthew Desmond is a social scientist and ethnographer revealing the impact of eviction on the lives of the urban poor and its role in perpetuating racial and economic inequality. In his investigations of the low-income rental market and eviction in privately owned housing in Milwaukee, Desmond argues persuasively that eviction is a cause, rather than merely a symptom, of poverty.

	He created the Milwaukee Area Renters Study, examined court records, and conducted extensive ethnographic fieldwork to construct a vivid picture of the remarkably high rates of eviction and the ways in which it disrupts the lives of low-income African Americans, in particular. His findings indicate that households headed by women are more likely to face eviction than men, resulting in deleterious long-term effects much like those caused by high rates of incarceration among low-income African American men. He also captures how landlords, local government, and city police interact with tenants, as well as the constrained choices and lack of agency suffered by low-income renters. For example, Desmond exposed the fact that women reporting domestic violence in Milwaukee were often evicted—the result of a local ordinance that classified such reports as “nuisance calls.” The ordinance has since been reconsidered, and Milwaukee has changed its policy of fining landlords whose tenants repeatedly called the police. The American Civil Liberties Union has challenged similar policies elsewhere.

	Desmond is also taking a fresh look at the survival strategies of struggling families, overturning the longstanding assumption among policymakers that the destitute turn to extended kin for assistance. Today, poor families often form intense, but brief relationships with strangers, creating a network of “disposable ties” to meet pressing needs. As Desmond brings his findings beyond academic circles in editorials and his forthcoming book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City (2016), he is shedding light on how entrenched poverty and racial inequality are built and sustained by housing policies in large American cities.

	About Matthew's Work

	Matthew Nock, a leading clinical psychologist of suicide and self-injury in adolescents and adults, has made significant breakthroughs associated with the very basic question of why people harm themselves. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among American adolescents and the tenth most common cause of death overall in the United States. The suicide rate has remained essentially unchanged in the United States over the past forty years, despite the de-stigmatization of mental illness, the increased availability of psychotropic medications, and increased funding for suicide research. Nock's research has markedly deepened our understanding of suicide and self-injury, with important implications for development of more effective treatment protocols. By combining epidemiology, laboratory experiments, measurement of implicit mental associations, and real-world, real-time biological and psychological assessments, Nock is able to document the nature, severity, and duration of the affective states of individuals considering or recently engaging in self-injury. For example, he discovered a behavioral marker — the extent to which a person associates his or her self-concept with death — and a method for obtaining objective measurements of the strength of the association that predict suicide attempts with much greater accuracy than traditional assessments. His studies of nonsuicidal self-injury (such as cutting and burning) among adolescents have demonstrated that these behaviors may serve an adaptive function by activating the body's ability to self-regulate runaway affective and cognitive states brought on by extreme anger, anxiety, or stress. Nock's current work includes cross-national studies of suicidal behavior that seek to discern those aspects of suicidal thinking and behavior that are universal at the phenomenological and neurobiological levels and those that are dependent on cultural context and environment. In a field that is inherently very difficult to study — there are no animal models for suicide — Nock is building ever-broader conceptual models of self-harm with the potential to save lives and to influence mental health care in our society.

	About Maurice's Work

	Maurice Lim Miller is a leader in the development of services and systems designed to break the cycle of economic dependency for low-income families across the United States.  Frustrated by the frequent recidivism into poverty he witnessed during his two decades with Asian Neighborhood Design, an agency focused on tenant rights, job training, and youth development, Lim Miller founded the Family Independence Initiative (FII) in 2001 with the goal of helping low-income working families—who often struggle in isolated circumstances or without clear direction—build their own pathways to self-sufficiency. FII has evolved into a national model that taps into the initiative and capability of low-income households to maximize their own networks and resources and guide themselves out of poverty. Unlike conventional, top-down poverty alleviation programs that proscribe rigid plans of action formulated by caseworkers, FII fosters an atmosphere that is part idea incubator and part learning laboratory among small cohorts who have organized themselves to assist one another. FII staff serve as an information resource but do not direct cohorts or make decisions; instead, they shift the responsibility for setting goals, finding solutions, and initiating action to participating members. Families receive small cash stipends for achieving their self-initiated objectives—such as finding employment, reducing debt, or saving toward buying a home—and for documenting and sharing their progress toward these goals. FII’s success is notable; in a recent review, participating Oakland families reported income gains averaging more than 25 percent over the two-year enrollment period, as well as significant improvement in the level of savings (up 144 percent) and in the grades of school-aged children. From its initial site in Oakland, FII has expanded to San Francisco, Oahu, and Boston, all of which have produced similarly positive results. In addressing the deficits of inspiration, motivation, and information with an infrastructure of peer-to-peer encouragement and social networking, Lim Miller is building more resilient communities from the ground up and offering an alternative to the current constellation of private and public anti-poverty initiatives.

	About Mel's Work

	Mel Chin is a category-defying artist whose practice calls attention to complex social and environmental issues. In an expansive body of work ranging from collages, sculptural objects, animated films, and video games to large-scale, collaboratively produced public installations, Chin demonstrates a unique ability to engage people from diverse backgrounds and to utilize unexpected materials and places.

	Chin initiated the GALA Committee, an artist collective, for the conceptual work In the Name of the Place (1994–1996), in which original works of art appeared in the background of scenes of the television drama Melrose Place. With visual messages that touched on issues like gender, the environment, and global conflict, Chin and collaborators effectively infiltrated the airwaves with challenging and topical art. Chin was an early pioneer of the practice that now falls under the rubric of socially engaged art, and he has undertaken several community-based projects that address environmental health. For Revival Field (1990–1993), he collaborated with a USDA agronomist to create an experimental “green remediation” garden on the site of a landfill that confirmed a scientific technology. Incorporating aspects of formal garden design, Revival Field is planted with species known to extract heavy metals from toxic soil. Chin’s Fundred Project (2006–present) has involved nearly half-a-million children and adults across the country who create their own paper currency, “fundred dollar bills,” in a collective effort to bring visibility to the widespread threat of lead poisoning. The “Fundred Reserve” has been displayed in museums, schools, and the halls of Congress, where it brought the value of constituent voices directly to members of Congress and served as an educational opportunity for community members and policymakers.

	Public spectacle and educational ambitions again combine in Chin’s two-part installation, Wake and Unmoored (2018), which occupied Times Square in 2018. Wake is a large-scale sculpture that assumes the form of a wrecked ship but also resembles the skeletal remains of a beached whale, while Unmoored exists as a mixed-reality experience that enables viewers to glimpse what Times Square would look like submerged under water as sea levels rise due to climate change. Through these and numerous other projects, Chin is redefining the parameters of contemporary art and challenging assumptions about the forms it can take, the issues it can address, and the settings it can inhabit.

	About Melanie's Work

	Melanie Sanford is a chemist reviving and enhancing approaches to organic synthesis previously set aside because of their technical difficulty. Her research focuses on using metal-based agents, primarily palladium, to catalyze reactions that substitute hydrogen in carbon-hydrogen bonds with other atoms or functional groups. Beginning with a reaction cycle widely regarded as too difficult to control, she developed a mechanism for taming palladium’s activity, making practical its application in the laboratory. Her methods enable modification of specific carbon bonds in complex molecules, while leaving other carbon bonds unchanged. These advances have significant impact for industrial chemistry, particularly in pharmaceuticals, where introduction of bonds like carbon-fluorine is desirable but frequently challenging in practice. Sanford's techniques often decrease the number of reaction steps necessary and increase the yield of the desired molecule. She pays equally careful attention to minimizing the generation of toxic by-products, thus contributing to the development of ""greener"" chemistry. Sanford is expanding her research program to include targeted synthesis of molecules with ""handedness"" — i.e., molecules having two configurations identical in shape but mirror images in their spatial orientation, like gloves. Limiting synthesis to a single orientation at the outset, rather than trying to separate a two-handed molecular mixture at the end, is a major objective in medicinal chemistry. Through her basic research on organometallic synthesis strategies, Sanford is opening new paths to making important compounds we use everyday, while diminishing the environmental impact of their manufacture.

	About Melody's Work

	Melody Swartz applies principles and methods from engineering and physiology to discover the mechanisms controlling the movement of biologic fluids through tissue and the implications for human health. Her research addresses fundamental questions regarding the chemical microenvironments that bathe solid tissues and the vascular remodeling that regulates them. These studies illuminate the basic processes of organ development and maintenance and, in particular, the immune responses to tumor invasion. Swartz adopts a multipronged approach to these investigations. She has developed in vitro models of tissue vasculature that allow direct manipulation or measurement of key biophysical properties in cellular microenvironments: for example, fluid pressure, flow rates, viscosity, and fluid sheer stresses. Her results indicate that, in addition to cell surface markers and chemical signals, direct mechanical forces can also have an important influence on tissue vascularization. Swartz has supplemented experimental studies with detailed mathematical models of hydrodynamics in the space between cells. Her body of research has important implications not only for normal tissue development and maintenance but also for cancer biology. She recently demonstrated, for example, that some solid tumors can secrete chemical signals that mimic the mechanisms used by lymphatic tissue (such as nodes of the spleen) to differentiate infected or invasive cells from normal ones. This observation suggests a possible mechanism that tumors use to protect against immune response. Drawing from a large toolbox of concepts and methods—including biophysics, cell culture, molecular genetics, engineering, and immunology—Swartz is enhancing our understanding of the dynamic process of tissue vascularization and its implications in normal and pathological conditions such as cancer.

	About Mercedes' Work

	Mercedes Doretti is a forensic anthropologist who unearths evidence of crimes against humanity, restoring voices to long-silenced victims and presenting critical findings to tribunals, human rights organizations, and special commissions around the globe. As a university student, Doretti co-founded the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF in Spanish) in 1984 to investigate the cases of men, women, and children who disappeared under the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. From its inception, EAAF’s multi-stage process has involved exhaustive historical research and interviews to locate clandestine graves; painstaking excavation and documentation of remains; determination of cause, manner, and time of death of victims; and the return of identified victims’ remains to families. Soon after commencing work in Argentina, Doretti and EAAF expanded their geographic scope, and they now work in more than 30 conflict-torn countries throughout Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Doretti’s approach is twofold — the collection of hard scientific evidence and implementation of new laboratory technologies for the identification of remains is complemented by compassionate, personal collaboration with grieving families during each step of the investigative process. In order to underscore the value of forensic anthropology in the promotion of human rights, she has produced field manuals and documentary videos about her work and led the development and training of other locally based teams around the world. From El Salvador to East Timor, Bosnia to Iraqi Kurdistan, Doretti makes witnesses of bones and seeks justice on behalf of populations whose immense losses have been omitted from the historical record.

	Michael Cohen is a pharmacist with a passion for patient safety and a commitment to reducing preventable drug and drug delivery mistakes that kill thousands of people each year in the United States. An early pioneer in an international movement to address medication error, Cohen is founder and president of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), a nonprofit clearinghouse for the distribution of impartial medical safety information to the healthcare community. As the number of available drugs and prescriptions filled each year continues to soar, many with look-alike or sound-alike names, Cohen is a recognized leader in promoting increased consumer vigilance, drug industry accountability, and practitioner responsibility. Through ISMP, he has championed improvements in drug naming, labeling, packaging, delivery systems, and regulation. At the cornerstone of his efforts, Cohen co-founded the continuous, voluntary, and confidential Medication Error Reporting Program (now administered by U.S. Pharmacopoeia), for medical professionals to learn about and understand the causes of errors across the nation. Where once errors were undisclosed and viewed as embarrassing to the healthcare industry, the active collection of these reports has helped generate practical and early responses and to combat potentially widespread and dangerous outcomes. For more than three decades, Cohen has played key roles in bringing about numerous corrections in error-prone products and practices. Today, he continues to be a major force in giving national visibility to the ubiquitous and serious problem of medication errors.

	About Michael's Work

	Michael Elowitz is a molecular biologist who is laying the groundwork for the next stage in the genomics revolution — understanding how genes interact. To do so, Elowitz employs a strategy of designing artificial genetic “circuits,” first modeling them computationally and then introducing the elements in vivo to test their activity. Experimenting with the first synthetic biological oscillator, he surprised many by demonstrating that even relatively simple negative feedback genetic regulation loops can generate complex behavior within a cell. His work revealed that, because of the low concentration of effector molecules, concepts familiar in electronics such as noise and bistability also find currency in explaining gene regulation. In another critical experiment, Elowitz showed that when two reporter genes with identical regulatory elements were engineered into bacteria they expressed themselves differently and that these differences were due to both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. More recently, he investigated the regulation of a complex stage in normal cellular differentiation of bacilli known as “competence” in which they are temporarily able to incorporate DNA from their external environment. Evidence from imaging studies and mathematical modeling suggest that the underlying genetic circuit consists of both positive and negative feedback loops. Through these and other studies, Elowitz is addressing the long-standing question of how cells can maintain a well-regulated state in a complex and noisy environment.

Dickinson’s investigations integrate a wide variety of scientific disciplines – muscle physiology, comparative anatomy, aerodynamics, biomechanics, neuroscience, and behavior – in an effort to produce a comprehensive understanding of this complex animal activity. He developed a robotic-fly model in which each of the parameters of wing movement could be carefully controlled and their effects on aerodynamics assessed. To understand how the fly’s brain controls these aerodynamic properties, Dickinson constructed a ""virtual reality"" arena where tethered flies can be subjected to a variety of visual and rotational stimuli in order to measure the compensatory neural responses.

	About Michael's Work

	Michael Manga is a geophysicist who applies his background in fluid dynamics to a wide variety of fundamental questions in geology. The phenomena he explores range in scale from microscopic to planetary; he draws insights from field measurements, numerical simulations, laboratory experiments, and even astronomical observations. Manga began his research career by investigating the fluid dynamics of magma.  He showed that the effects of bubbles or gas pockets in a liquid can alter shearing rates as a function of fluid viscosity, surface tension between liquid and gas, bubble size, and number of bubbles. He and colleagues subsequently showed how crystal and bubble orientations preserved in volcanic rocks reflect the straining forces imposed on subterranean magma. More recently, Manga has used surface water flux to explore the redistribution of stress through the Earth's crust following an earthquake. Somewhat surprisingly, tiny deformation in water-saturated rock due to distant earthquakes can trigger local earthquakes, changes in groundwater flow, or shifts in underground magma. These results offer the possibility of better identification of regional seismic hazards and forecasting of seismic activity. He does not limit his investigations strictly to terrestrial matters, however; other studies consider the fluid dynamics of planetary evolution, exploring volcanism on Mars and tidal pressures on the ice sheet of Jupiter's moon, Europa. In the laboratory, he uses tanks of corn syrup to model the geophysical properties of these astronomical bodies. Through his coordinated fieldwork, experimentation, and simulation, Manga has opened new avenues for understanding a wide and ever-growing range of geological phenomena.

	About Michael's Work

	Michael Walsh is an independent engineer and policy analyst committed to improving regional public health and the global environment by reducing the impact of internal combustion engines on air quality. Beginning in the 1980’s with his work shaping legislation that significantly reduced lead emissions in the United States, Walsh has developed a reputation for finding effective and practical solutions to thorny public policy problems. His bimonthly publication, Car Lines, is widely recognized by governments, manufacturers, and research institutions as a vital resource for information regarding technical advances in emissions control and trends in regulatory policies. Because of his encyclopedic knowledge of international standards, engineering policy, and air pollutant chemistry, government agencies throughout the world turn to him to help tailor policies to protect air quality that accommodate local priorities and economic conditions. In Central America and Asia, Walsh has demonstrated how leapfrogging emissions standards of the most industrialized economies positions other economies to become centers of advanced technology. Recently, he has turned his attention to reducing sulfur emissions from diesel engines, helping to design fuel standards in the U.S. and elsewhere. With projections of over 1 billion vehicles on the roads worldwide by the year 2025, the problem of protecting health and air quality looms large. By virtue of his indefatigable commitment, soft-spoken persuasion, and unrivaled expertise, Walsh continues to play an important and strategic role in translating science into effective policy action.

	About Michal's Work

	Michal Lipson is an optical physicist working at the intersection of fundamental photonics and silicon fabrication engineering to develop devices that harness the information-processing capabilities of light. Although manufacturing conventional digital chips etched in silicon is a mature technology, these electronic circuits cannot match the theoretical speed and capacity of optical systems. Lipson has emerged as a leader, despite relatively modest resources, in designing optical and hybrid opto-electronic devices with silicon-based fabrication methods. Carefully regulated etching of silicon can create linear or circular paths (waveguides) for light to traverse; Lipson has demonstrated that ring modulators (circular waveguides) can effectively serve as switches for light passing through adjacent linear waveguides when the frequency of light pumped into the modulators is precisely tuned relative to the linear waveguide. Her continued refinement of both opto-electronic and purely optical circuits has decreased their size, increased their efficiency, and accelerated their switching speed. The resulting silicon-based photonic integrated circuits have the potential to improve signal transmission and processing dramatically. Lipson’s elegant solutions to a variety of theoretical and engineering challenges in silicon photonics are paving the way for the future development of practical and powerful optical computing devices.

	About Michelle's Work

	Michelle Dorrance is a tap dancer and choreographer breathing new life into a uniquely American art form in works that combine the musicality of tap with the choreographic intricacies of contemporary dance. Dorrance uses her deep understanding of the technique and history of tap dancing to deconstruct and reimagine its artistic possibilities.

	Tap is primarily an aural dance form, with dancers creating complex syncopations through technical feats of footwork. In a high-contrast physical style, Dorrance maintains the essential layering of rhythms in tap but choreographs ensemble works that engage the entire body: dancers swoop, bend, leap, and twist with a dramatic expression that is at once musical and visual. In SOUNDspace (2011), she shapes the architecture of the stage space by moving dancers in and out of view; the dancers create an acoustic chamber as the audience is surrounded with textured rhythms created by leather, wood, and metal taps on the stage, backstage, and balcony.

	Dorrance has moved beyond the episodic nature of traditional tap pieces—with solo dancers competing for the most audacious phrase—to craft evening-length ensemble works that tell compelling stories through rhythm and the arrangement of visual information. The Blues Project (2013) is an encyclopedic depiction of the history of the blues as told through tap-based works as well as an active collaboration between the dancers and the musicians who accompany them. In ETM: The Initial Approach (2014), Dorrance creates a fusion of acoustic and electronic sound. The dancers perform on platforms that are activated by their contact to emit sounds and enable electronic looping, allowing a real-time exploration of how movement and sound affect each other. Dorrance’s choreographic sense of tap as a musical and visual expression is bringing it to entirely new contexts and enhancing the appreciation of tap as an innovative, serious, and evolving art form.

	About Miguel's Work

	Miguel Zenón is a young jazz musician who is expanding the boundaries of Latin and jazz music through his elegant and innovative musical collages. As both a saxophonist and a composer, Zenón demonstrates an astonishing mastery of old and new jazz idioms, from Afro-Caribbean and Latin American rhythmical concepts to free and avant-garde jazz. Beginning with his 2001 recording Looking Forward, Zenón has exhibited a high degree of daring and sophistication in the manipulation of conventional jazz forms. His third album, Jíbaro (2005), illuminates his intense engagement with the indigenous music of his native Puerto Rico. Forgoing the Afro-Caribbean sound that characterizes most Latin jazz, Zenón was inspired by la música jíbara — string-based folkloric music popular in the Puerto Rican countryside. Unlike other attempts to fuse jazz and jíbaro, which have retained the traditional instrumentation with little harmonic variation, in Zenón’s hands the essential elements of jíbaro serve as the compositional and rhythmic underpinning of his contemporary jazz arrangements. The result is a complex yet accessible sound that is overflowing with feeling and passion and maintains the integrity of the island’s music. This young musician and composer is at once reestablishing the artistic, cultural, and social tradition of jazz while creating an entirely new jazz language for the 21st century.

	About Mimi's Work

	Mimi Lien is a set designer for theater, opera, and dance whose bold, immersive designs shape and extend a dramatic text’s narrative and emotional dynamics. Lien combines training in set design and architecture with an innate dramaturgical insight, and she is adept at configuring a performance space to establish particular relationships—both among the characters on stage and between the audience and the actors—that dramatize the play’s movement through space and time. 

	In sets for both large-scale immersive works and for more traditional proscenium stages, Lien envelops the audience in a specific mood or atmosphere. For Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812 (2013), Lien designed a full-scale Tsarist Russian salon that summoned up the decadence of early nineteenth-century Moscow and the chaotic emotional lives of the Russian elite. Her simple and stark set for Born Bad (2011)—brown shag carpet, worn wallpaper, and three wooden chairs on a platform that is overhung by a low ceiling—created a claustrophobic environment that heightened the play’s portrayal of family tensions.

	For other works, Lien choreographs the movement of set pieces so that they become participants in the dramatic action. She propelled the narrative action forward in An Octoroon (2014), as a series of cascading false walls enacted a sequence of startling set transformations. With surrealist touches such as a sloping floor and an aperture that opened and closed to create a sliver of light suggesting a tightrope, Lien brought to life the eeriness of Hades’ underworld in Eurydice (2008), while also evincing the devotion of Eurydice’s father as he constructs (onstage) a string room for her that is held aloft by helium balloons. In projects that range from large regional theaters, to small experimental, hybrid pieces, to a performance in an 81-acre meadow, Lien is revitalizing the visual language of theater and enhancing the performance experience for theater-makers and viewers alike.

	About My Hang's Work

	My Hang Huynh is a scientist working at the boundary of organic and inorganic chemistry to devise novel techniques for synthesizing highly energetic compounds. Energetic compounds such as explosives are employed in a wide variety of applications but pose hazards in two respects: thermostability and environmental contamination. Huynh has developed a new class of reactions based on constituents such as azides and alkynes that address both issues. The thermodynamic properties of substances she has synthesized make them remarkably stable under a wide temperature range, and their structure allows the substitution of toxic heavy metals such as lead or mercury with more benign elements like copper and iron. Moreover, the methods that she has developed highlight the potential for nitrogen-based reaction centers to serve as the backbone in the synthesis of complex molecules, challenging the orthodoxy of synthetic approaches based on covalent carbon bonding in organic chemistry. Huynh's advances also promise to improve the safety of workers, such as miners and military personnel, who are chronically exposed to energetic materials. In addition, the large amount of inert nitrogen gas generated in the detonation of her novel compounds suggests the possibility of new safety applications, including fire prevention in malfunctioning jet engines and improved air bag design.

	Nancy Folbre is an economist whose work explores how nonmarket production contributes to human and community development and economic growth.

	Folbre's research includes expanded definitions of human and social capital to include family, gender, political status, and other power relationships. Her research on the family, on the work roles of family members, and on the relationships among those roles has challenged traditional economic theory. Folbre's alternative models focus on arrangements of what she calls “caring labor,” which recognize the separate, different, and essential roles that men and women play within a family. Her model allows for an accounting of the competing claims that children and older people have on the scarce resource of caring labor.

	Biography

	Folbre is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She is the author of several books, including The Ultimate Field Guide to the U.S. Economy (1988, rev. 2000), Who Pays for the Kids? (1994), The War on the Poor: A Defense Manual (1996), and The Invisible Heart: Economics and Family Values (2001). She is also the co-editor of Family Time: The Social Organization of Care (2004).

	About Nancy's Work

	Nancy Rabalais is a marine ecologist who is dedicated to documenting and mitigating the effects of hypoxic zones—aquatic areas with low dissolved oxygen levels commonly known as “dead zones”—that have expanded dramatically in the Gulf of Mexico and many other coastal systems around the globe. Since the mid-1980s, she has led a long-term monitoring program to study the size, intensity, and seasonal occurrence of dead zones in the waters off the Louisiana continental shelf; she has also analyzed the relationship between the extent of hypoxia and the increasing quantities of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus flowing into the Gulf from the Mississippi River watershed. When concentrated in coastal waters, the nutrients from farmland fertilizer and other sources spur the growth of an overabundance of algae, the decomposition of which consumes oxygen vital to sustaining an enormous spectrum of aquatic species. Over the past three decades, Rabalais’s studies have evolved to include collaborations with researchers from many different disciplines and have used methods from physical oceanography, hydrology, geochemistry, and paleoecology to make ever more precise assessments of hypoxia dynamics and their impact on a range of fragile, interconnected ecosystems. In addition to her scientific contributions, Rabalais has played a prominent role in informing strategies to restore the degraded waters of the Gulf by reducing nutrient pollution from urban and agricultural runoff upstream and has focused national attention on the environmental and economic consequences of large-scale eutrophication. Her outreach efforts have included lecturing throughout the United States about the effects of hypoxia on those far from its waters, testifying before Congress, and working with federal, state, and tribal agencies on an action plan for improving water quality in the Mississippi River basin. While weathering the destruction of her research facility in catastrophic hurricanes and treacherous diving conditions due to oil spills, Rabalais continues to deepen our understanding of this profound oceanographic problem that threatens the well-being of the entire Gulf region.

	About Nancy's Work

	Nancy Siraisi is a historian of medicine whose erudite and insightful works have opened up new areas of inquiry within medieval and Renaissance history. Whereas most studies of the period have focused almost exclusively on the influence of ancient Greek and medieval Arabic manuscripts on Renaissance medicine, Siraisi considers a much broader context in her analyses of texts written by and about medical practitioners. Her meticulously researched volumes elucidate the historical milieu in which the physicians lived and the profound impact of medical theory and practice on Renaissance society, culture, and religion. For instance, her lively account of the life and career of Taddeo Alderotti, one of Bologna’s most illustrious physicians, and his students explores the interaction between physicians’ participation in the intellectual life of medieval Italy and the development of medical theory in the 13th and early 14th centuries. By concentrating on medicine in her biography of the 16th-century polymath Girolamo Cardano — who was a physician, astrologer, autobiographer, mathematician, and natural philosopher — Siraisi offers new perspectives on the history of these fields and illuminates essential aspects of Renaissance medical practice. In her most recent work, Siraisi brings her analysis up to the early modern period to examine the intersections between medicine and the wider world of learning. In particular, she demonstrates the key role physicians writing about their craft played in the emergence of history as a discipline. Regarded as a leading scholar of the field in the U.S. and Europe, Siraisi continues to provide contributions to the evolving scholarly understanding of medical history and, specifically, Renaissance intellectual history.

	About Naomi's Work 

	Naomi Leonard is an engineer who develops autonomous underwater vehicles. This work synthesizes elements as diverse as fluid mechanics, robotics, computer science, oceanography, and biology. Leonard's initial efforts focused on single vehicles that have the means to control motion directly in some, but not all, dimensions. She showed how ""energy-shaping"" methods could be used to generate stable feedback control; these results have found application beyond robotics, extending control theory for mechanical systems in general. With this theoretical foundation, Leonard moved to the design of coordinated control of arrays of multiple mobile agents. In collaboration with the mathematicians, oceanographers, and biologists of the Adaptive Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN) project, she has investigated how biological groups (such as flocking birds and schooling fish) coordinate their motion and how to get man-made mobile autonomous agents to mimic that behavior. Beyond its contributions to engineering and behavioral science, autonomous underwater technology allows oceanographers to place measuring instruments in the right place at the right time to collect data essential for understanding the physical forces controlling ocean dynamics. The technology also holds significant promise for a variety of military defense applications.

	About Natalia's Work

	Natalia Almada is a filmmaker revealing rich new perspectives on Mexican history, politics, and culture in insightful and poetic films that push the boundaries of how the documentary form addresses social issues. A dual citizen of Mexico and the United States who has lived in both countries since childhood, Almada does not use conventional structures or techniques, such as interviews with specialists or a linear timeline. Instead, she incorporates powerful visual images and the observations of ordinary people she encounters with her camera into an intimate, multilayered form of storytelling. In El General (2009), Almada weaves together archival material; audio tapes of her grandmother’s recollections of Almada’s great-grandfather, Mexico’s president Plutarco Elías Calles (1924–28); and compelling footage of Mexico City during the contested presidential election of 2006. The result is a lyrical, quietly mesmerizing meditation on the legacy of Mexico’s political history, the relationship between personal and collective memory, and how memory informs one’s view of self, family, and country. Almada creates a striking and moving portrayal of the violence of drug trafficking and its effects on Mexican society in El Velador (2011). Although there are no scenes of violence in this haunting and contemplative film, it conveys the overwhelming crisis of the drug war through snippets of radio and television broadcasts, the sounds of construction in an ever-expanding cemetery, and the quiet imagery of families visiting the graves of loved ones. In films that pose more questions than they answer, Almada is capturing complex and nuanced views of the issues that define Mexican-American relations while reaffirming the potency of documentary both as an art form and a powerful medium for highlighting the often unseen implications of social conflict.

Natalie Diaz,2018-06-15,40,Female,Poet,"Department of English, Arizona State University","Tempe, Arizona",Poetry,"
                  
	About Natalie's Work 

	Natalie Diaz is a poet blending personal, political, and cultural references in works that challenge the systems of belief underlying contemporary American culture. She connects her own experiences as a Mojave American and Latina woman to widely recognized cultural and mythological touchstones, creating a personal mythology that viscerally conveys the oppression and violence that continue to afflict Indigenous Americans in a variety of forms.

	In her first collection, When My Brother Was an Aztec (2012), Diaz reflects on her brother’s drug addiction, drawing upon Mojave, Greek, and Christian symbols to describe his destructive behavior and its effect on her family. Her brother is alternately a charismatic Icarus persuading his parents to let him come home again, the figure of Judas betraying his family, and most hauntingly, an Aztec god who devours his parents every morning. In “My Brother at 3 A.M.,” addiction is personified as the Devil, seen by her brother in his hallucinatory state and then by her mother as she recognizes her son’s brutal and desperate condition. Other poems in the collection focus on Diaz’s childhood on a reservation.  “Hand-Me-Down Halloween” is an angry eruption of language that ensues in the wake of the speaker being taunted by a white boy for wearing a secondhand Tonto costume. She takes a more satirical and wry approach in “The Last Mojave Indian Barbie,” folding a biting critique of economic inequality, stereotyping, appropriation, body-image issues, and consumer culture into a series of tableaux centering around a Barbie of Mojave identity trying to fit into a standard Barbie universe.

	Diaz ends the book with poems about an unnamed beloved, and in more recent poems she has continued to explore expressions of Indigenous love in nature, family, and community. Other recent poems, such as “American Arithmetic”—about police violence against Native Americans—and “The First Water Is the Body”—written in honor of the Standing Rock protesters and her own Mojave people—engage directly with the bodily oppression of Indigenous Americans and the urgency of survival. Diaz is a powerful new poetic voice, and she is broadening the venues for and reach of Indigenous perspectives through her teaching, cross-disciplinary collaborations, and language preservation efforts.

His broad explorations typically incorporate aspects of fundamental physics, such as fluid dynamics, acoustics, or optics, but his aim is not primarily didactic. Rather, his highly tuned visual sensibility and his inventive and winning examinations inspire appreciation and respect of the natural world. Converting abstract principles into tangible representations, Kahn’s work is accessible to a vast and diverse audience, attracting and holding the attention of children, adults, artists, and physicists alike. Some viewers wonder about the underlying mechanisms; others are captivated by the sensorial experience. Sometimes dramatic (e.g., singing tornados of flame), sometimes tranquil (e.g., gently rotating vortices of waterpools), Kahn's exhibits strike an emotional chord, reminding the viewer of nature's capacity to inspire apprehension, serenity, wonder, and awe. By transcending the distinction between art and exhibit, Kahn simultaneously employs art to convey abstract scientific principles, and nature to serve as a tool for aesthetic expression.

	About Nergis' Work

	Nergis Mavalvala is a physicist whose research links the world of quantum mechanics, normally apparent only at the atomic scale, with some of the most powerful, yet elusive, forces in the cosmos. Although predicted by General Relativity Theory, gravitational waves—fluctuations in space-time curvature that propagate as waves in a pond—are very difficult to observe directly. As a graduate student, Mavalvala developed a prototype laser interferometer for detecting gravitational waves. This early work led to the identification of an important stabilization principle that was later incorporated into the design for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), a collaboration among scores of physicists and currently the most sensitive observatory of its kind. Mavalvala’s more recent research focuses on minimizing, if not circumventing, barriers imposed by quantum physics on the precision of standard optical interferometers. One strategy she uses is to cool the macroscopic components of the device (i.e., the mirrors) into a coherent quantum state; such components, large enough to see without magnification, exhibit bizarre quantum properties previously observed only at the atomic level. Applying strategies such as this at the scale of the LIGO instruments (i.e., kilogram-scale mirrors separated by kilometers) has the potential to boost significantly the sensitivity of the device. Through this and other technically challenging, unconventional approaches, such as squeezed coherent states and optical springs, Mavalvala is making fundamental contributions to physics at the intersection of optics, condensed matter, and quantum mechanics. Her experimental advances are enhancing our ability to detect and quantify gravitational radiation with still greater precision, data that may be critical to incorporating gravitation within a unified theory of the basic forces in the universe.

	About Nicholas' Work

	Nicholas Benson is a third-generation stone carver, calligrapher, and designer whose meticulously executed inscriptional works are noted for their uncompromising craftsmanship and beauty in form and line. While almost all cut-stone lettering in the United States is done by machines today, Benson is a master of hand letter carving, using brush strokes to outline the individual letterforms before inscribing them in situ by hand. His inscriptions and decorative reliefs can be seen on family memorials and buildings throughout the United States, including the National Gallery of Art, the Yale University Art Gallery, and the National World War II Memorial. In creating the distinctive architectural lettering for which he is known, Benson considers both the large-scale effect of the overall text as well as the most minute details of each figure, weighing at the same time changing light conditions and the long-term impact of weathering on the work’s future appearance. Combining his scholarly interest in the history of letterforms and their design, he developed an original font that draws on both classical Greek forms and contemporary sans serif script for the new Dr. Martin Luther King National Memorial. While Benson expands the traditional art of stone carving through his designs, he is also committed to teaching young artisans, who will create their own works and ensure that the legacy of this centuries-old artistic practice endures.

	About Nicole's Work

	Nicole Eisenman is an artist who is expanding the critical and expressive capacity of the Western figurative tradition through works that engage contemporary social issues and phenomena. Over the course of nearly four decades and working across various media, including painting, sculpture, drawing, and printmaking, Eisenman has restored to the representation of the human form a cultural significance that had waned during the ascendancy of abstraction in the twentieth century.

	She draws on narrative and rhetorical modes—including allegory and satire—to explore such themes as gender and sexuality, family dynamics, and inequalities of wealth and power. At the same time, she stages dialogues with artists from the past, both by referencing specific works and by employing stylistic and thematic approaches derived from art historical movements. In a series of paintings of beer-garden scenes (2008­– ), for example, Eisenman updates Renoir’s tableaux of bourgeois leisure, replacing the nineteenth-century French characters that populate Renoir’s originals with a dense, New York crowd. The Triumph of Poverty (2009) presents a complex allegory of contemporary economic conditions. Eisenman’s skill as a painter of imaginative compositions is evidenced not only through the array of social types represented but also through the bold contrasts of color that inject the work with emotional and psychological intensity.

	As a draftswoman, Eisenman deftly conveys the weight and movement of the human body through skillful manipulations of line and shading. In her print Man Holding His Shadow (2011), she uses lithography, a medium at one remove from the artist’s hand, to reflect on the limits of representation while maintaining her painterly style of mark making. More recently, she has brought her wry, intelligent vision to sculpture, proving that she is equally adept at imagining and shaping forms in three dimensions. In her challenging engagement with the human figure and investigation of social meaning, Eisenman is developing new conventions of figuration to address enduring themes of the human condition.

	About Nicole's Work

	Nicole King is a biologist who is reconstructing a critical event in the evolution of life – the emergence of multicellular organisms that form the base of the animal (metazoan) kingdom. Although the unicellular progenitors of animals are long gone, King has focused on organisms known as choanoflagellates, a putative outgroup in the early history of metazoan development. Choanoflagellates are unicellular organisms that share some morphological features with animal cells; some species also form colonies. Using molecular genetic techniques, King isolated from choanoflagellates two types of genes: adhesion molecules and receptor tyrosine kinases. These genes are critical for maintaining the physical integrity of tissues and for intercellular communication, respectively; they were previously believed to exist only in animals. Furthermore, she demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase activity reduces the rate of cell division in choanoflagellates, indicating a functional homology of these genes with their orthologs in animals. With these results, King has shown that the genes necessary for multicellular organization predate the emergence of the metazoan kingdom. She argues that demonstrating the existence of genes does not, however, imply that they are working in a coordinated fashion. In her future research, King plans to use whole organism sequence data to compare the functional genomic organization of choanoflagellates with early metazoans such as the sponge family.

	About Nikole's Work

	Nikole Hannah-Jones is an investigative journalist chronicling the demise of racial integration efforts and persistence of segregation in American society, particularly in education. She combines analyses of historical, academic, and policy research with moving personal narratives to bring into sharp relief a problem that many are unwilling to acknowledge still exists and its tragic consequences for African American individuals, families, and communities.

	Her profile of three generations of a family in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in ""Segregation Now"" (2014) illustrates the historical trajectory of segregation in many school districts in the South. A grandfather attended school before judicial force dismantled Jim Crow–era segregated schools; his daughter, a college graduate, was educated in an integrated school district. But after the district was released from judicial oversight in the 1990s, it effectively became re-segregated; his granddaughter now attends an all-black school that is so poorly resourced it leaves its students far behind their white counterparts. After the shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, Hannah-Jones spent several months investigating a short-lived integration program in the (mostly white, high-achieving) school district 30 miles from (all-black, almost entirely poor, and unaccredited) Normandy School District, where Brown attended high school. The resulting hour-long radio piece, ""The Problem We All Live With"" (2015), unflinchingly conveys the failings of our educational system and exposes how the decisions we make as individuals and collectively as a society have created and perpetuate our two-tier education system. In a particularly poignant section, Hannah-Jones juxtaposes the delight and joy in the voices of a student and her mother contemplating the opportunity to apply to a high school outside of Normandy with the voices of white parents decrying the violence and drop in test scores that they claim will result from the influx of Normandy students.

	Hannah-Jones's deeply personal account of her own experience as a parent in New York City's public school system, ""Choosing a School for My Daughter in a Segregated City"" (2016), shows that school segregation is not an isolated phenomenon but rather a defining factor of most cities across the country. Currently at work on a book about school segregation, Hannah-Jones is compelling us to confront segregation as a fundamental cause of racial disparities and reshaping national conversations about education reform.

	About Njideka's Work

	Njideka Akunyili Crosby is a figurative painter whose large-scale works express the hybridity characteristic of transnational experience through choices of subject matter, materials, and techniques.

	Born and raised in Nigeria but living now in the United States, Akunyili Crosby layers paint, fabric, and photographic source imagery that she transfers or collages onto her surfaces. She constructs scenes that often include figures, sometime family members, situated in domestic settings. Gleaned from family photos, cutouts from Nigerian newspapers and magazines, and commemorative cloth, the appropriated elements signal the works' engagement with the world beyond the here and now of the interior scene described—the world of events and history, both collective and personal. For example, in Nwantini (2012), the light and shadows that define the left arm and thigh of the recumbent male figure are the effect of carefully arranged photographic representations of a range of domestic, commercial, and historical scenes. Thus, the painting contains a density of references that convey meaning across multiple registers and speak to disparate times and places simultaneously. This layering also lends a ghostly quality to the pieces. In Super Blue Omo (2016), the legs of the seated female figure appear to be projected onto the work's surface. Many layers of materials from different sources overlay one another, with the final effect being that of an image that refuses to stay fixed, vacillating across different cultures and traditions. While her source imagery often references her African heritage, Akunyili Crosby's works also frequently depict her experiences living in the United States and the point of contact where cultures meet—for example, I Still Face You (2015) portrays her American-born husband seated at a table with her family.

	In her explorations of the complexities of forging identity in a globalized society, Akunyili Crosby is developing an inventive yet accessible representational strategy for understanding culture and history from multiple viewpoints all at once.

	About Ocean's Work

	Ocean Vuong is a poet and fiction writer whose works explore the ongoing trauma of war and conditions of exile with tragic eloquence and clarity. The child of illiterate rice farmers from rural Vietnam, Vuong came to the United States as a refugee with his family at the age of two. His poetry is infused with the rhythm, cadences, and imagery of rural Vietnamese oral storytelling and folkloric traditions married to a restless experimentation with the English language.

	In Night Sky with Exit Wounds (2016), his first full-length collection of poetry, the political and the sensual are often intertwined. “Aubade with Burning City” is a tableau of the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, that juxtaposes the violence on the streets with the ethereal intimacy of lovers’ final moments together. The lyrics of the song “White Christmas,” which was played on U.S. Armed Forces Radio to signal the final evacuation of American citizens, appear in haunting fragments throughout the poem. At times, Vuong uses silence to render depth of feeling. “Seventh Circle of Earth,” about the 2011 murder of a gay couple by immolation in Dallas, Texas, is written in its entirety as footnotes. The footnote numbers run down an otherwise empty page, reinforcing the erasure wrought by the violence, and the text of the poem is formatted as short quotations in the footnotes themselves, with slashes indicating line breaks. Vuong continues to explore related themes of loss, survival, and the bridging of disparate worlds through language in his novel, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous (2019). Structured as a letter from a son to his mother, who cannot speak English or read in any language, the loosely autobiographical novel is a tangle of personal and colonial histories. In short sections that are each distinct memories, it moves from war-torn Vietnam to a teenager’s first sexual experiences. The language shifts as the narrator makes himself more vulnerable to his interlocutor; the dense prose used to describe childhood memories becomes an elegy, then a meditation, and finally a series of broken phrases about the tragic end of his first love. The novel concludes on a hopeful note, however, with the narrator determined to embrace joy, ambition, and future opportunities for love.

	Still early in his career, Vuong is a vital new literary voice demonstrating mastery of multiple poetic registers while addressing the effects of intergenerational trauma, the refugee experience, and the complexities of identity and desire.

	Biography

	Ocean Vuong received a BA (2012) from Brooklyn College of the City University of New York and an MFA (2016) from New York University. He is an assistant professor in the MFA Program for Poets and Writers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

	Quote from Ocean

	Words are, in a sense, bodies moving from one space to another.

	Language, like people, can be perpetually in flux. Words are, in a sense, bodies moving from one space to another. Our very cells, too, are always moving. They are just overflowing, and dying, and being reborn. What is seemingly so static is actually constantly in motion. Literature, then, is movement—but it is also the measure of movement in our species' thinking and feeling. To participate in that great migration, as a writer, is the ultimate gift.

	About Okwui's Work 

	Okwui Okpokwasili is a performer, choreographer, and writer creating multidisciplinary performance pieces that draw viewers into the interior lives of women of color, particularly those of African and African American women, whose stories have long been overlooked and rendered invisible. The child of immigrants from Nigeria, Okpokwasili was born and raised in the Bronx, and the histories of these places and the girls and women who inhabit them feature prominently in much of her work. Her productions are highly experimental in form, bringing together elements of dance, theater, and the visual arts (with spare and distinctive sets designed by her husband and collaborator, Peter Born).

	For the one-woman show Bronx Gothic (2014), she draws upon the disparate storytelling traditions of Victorian epistolary novels and West African griot poets. As Okpokwasili reads from a series of intimate notes exchanged by two black girls navigating the early years of adolescence in the 1980s, her body shudders, buckles, and slams to the floor. Through the intensity and duration of her movements, her body becomes, in effect, the medium through which long-buried experiences—of friendship, sexual awakening, daydreams, and nightmares—are conjured and shared. Her more recent performance piece, Poor People’s TV Room (2017), takes a similarly hybrid, nonlinear form and explores how Nigeria’s past and present collide and fragment within the body. The piece asks the question of whether the legacy of oppression and collective resistance has a psychic resonance that resides beyond conscious memory. She is one of a multigenerational ensemble of four women who perform intricately scored sequences, incantatory monologues, dialogues, and songs loosely inspired by the Bring Back Our Girls movement, launched in response to the Boko Haram kidnappings of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls in 2014, and the Women’s War of 1929, when thousands of Igbo women revolted against British colonial powers. The piece captures African and African American women entangled in the shadows of the forgotten women who came before them, while attempting to write their own futures. The memories of the embodied protests and the collective actions of Nigerian women from the past come rushing back into the present in unwieldy pieces.

	A versatile and virtuosic performer in her own works and in those of other choreographers, filmmakers, and theater artists, she mesmerizes audiences with her shape-shifting character play, sinuous grace, and rich, hypnotic voice. Okpokwasili is making visible the aspects of black womanhood that have been left out of dominant cultural narratives and evoking in audiences a profound sense of empathy for the pain, resilience, fears, and desires that each of her gestures makes manifest.

	About Olivier's Work

	Olivier Guyon is a physicist who uses his expertise in optics to design telescopes that investigate some of the most compelling issues in contemporary astronomy, particularly the search for Earth-like planets outside the solar system. From our perspective, extrasolar planets (exoplanets) appear to orbit extremely close to their home stars but are ten orders of magnitude less bright; the ability to visualize exoplanets with conventional coronagraphs (which block light coming directly from a star) is a function of a telescope’s mirror diameter times four. Guyon invented an alternative coronagraphy method, Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA), which could reduce by nearly half the necessary instrument mirror diameter. This design significantly reduces the engineering and cost obstacles to deploying a planet-locating telescope in low-Earth orbit. Subsequently, Guyon identified the theoretical limit on the performance of such instruments; based on this analysis and related computational models, he compared the expected performance of several methods currently in use or under development, identifying their relative strengths and shortcomings. Currently, he is working to optimize the performance of ground-based PIAA instruments and their variants. Guyon has also made important contributions to other aspects of instrumentation, such as adaptive optics and low-cost, lightweight telescopes for amateurs. He is developing a diffraction-based technique for measuring tiny shifts in the position of stars against the stellar background due to the gravitational influence of orbiting planets, which could provide a powerful complement to existing exoplanet detection methods. In all aspects of his work, from theoretical calculations to laboratory fabrication, Guyon relentlessly tests and pushes boundaries to construct instruments that are key to one of the great scientific adventures of our time—searching the galaxy for other planets like our own.

	About Olufunmilayo's Work

	Olufunmilayo Olopade is an oncologist who translates her basic research on individual and population cancer susceptibility into an effective clinical practice for treating breast cancer among African and African-American women. Trained in clinical oncology and cancer genetics, her early research led to the identification of a tumor suppressor locus on the short arm of the 9th chromosome. Her more recent work focuses more specifically on the molecular genetics of breast cancer in women of African heritage. Tumors of this population demonstrate distinct biological characteristics, including a high level of aggressiveness and resistance to treatment. Olopade first described recurrent BRCA1 mutations in extended African-American families with breast cancer, and reported BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in pre-menopausal breast cancer patients from West Africa. As founding director of the Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics at the University of Chicago, Olopade leads the application of her research from the bench to the bedside. She oversees a coordinated, multidisciplinary, clinical program that includes oncologists, primary care physicians, genetic counselors, sociologists, and psychologists and provides free access to genetic services for local, at-risk populations. Currently, Olopade also heads a West African clinical trial for a pill form of chemotherapy as treatment for women with advanced breast cancer.  In bridging continents with her innovative research and service models, Olopade is increasing the probability of improved outcomes for millions of women of African heritage at risk for cancer here and abroad.

	About Ornette's Work

	Ornette Coleman is a musician and a composer long recognized as an influential figure in the history of jazz.

	His innovative harmolodic theory of music abandons Western conventions of harmony and rhythm, and offers musicians an expanded tonal language with which to compose and improvise.  Coleman’s occasional use of the non-tempered scale, his abandonment of chord changes and the conventions of the 32-bar AABA song form, and improvisational interplay between musicians are characteristic features of his approach.  His album entitled Free Jazz (1960) gave a name to this new music style.

	In addition to being featured on many jazz compilations, his albums include Who’s Crazy (1966), Science Fiction (1971), In All Languages (1987), and Tone Dialing (1995).  Coleman has written several modernist concert pieces, notably the orchestral Skies of America (1972), and movie soundtracks including Naked Lunch (1992).  He is the subject of a film, Ornette: Made in America (1984), compiled from early career footage.

	Biography

	Coleman is a self-taught composer, and a performer on alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet, and violin.  He attended the Lenox School of Jazz in Massachusetts in 1959.  In the 1970s he studied and recorded with the Master Musicians of Jajouka in Morocco, anticipating by a decade the worldwide interest in African music.

	About Osvaldo's Work

	Osvaldo Golijov is a composer who blends classical forms with the rhythms and melodies of other genres to create a concert experience that resonates deeply with contemporary audiences. Drawing on diverse musical (e.g., tango, roma, and klezmer) and literary traditions (such as the poems of Emily Dickinson and Pablo Neruda), Golijov’s compositions exhibit a fresh, powerful style. Golijov synthesized the prayers and folk songs of his Jewish heritage with the Latin and classical traditions of his Argentine homeland to craft two pieces, Yiddishbbuk (1992) and The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind (1994), that seamlessly harmonize the disparate customs of his youth. His recent Pasión Según San Marcos (2000) further explores his syncretic musical heritage as it stylistically and visually reimagines Bach’s Passions on the streets of Cuba and Brazil. This latest work, a sophisticated play on the word and concept of passion, exemplifies the way in which Golijov’s thoughtful artistry is enlivening and expanding the breadth of the contemporary classical music scene.

	Biography

	Osvaldo Golijov studied composition at the Rubin Academy of Jerusalem and received his Ph.D. (1990) from the University of Pennsylvania. He was a Fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center (1990) before joining the Department of Music at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1991. Golijov also serves on the faculties of the Boston Conservatory and the Tanglewood Music Center. His works have been performed by numerous ensembles and orchestras, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Kronos Quartet, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the London Sinfonietta.

	About Pamela's Work

	Pamela O. Long is an independent historian of science and technology who is rewriting the history of science, demonstrating how technologies and crafts are deeply enmeshed in the broader cultural fabric. Through meticulous analysis of textual, visual, antiquarian, and archival materials from across Europe, Long investigates how literacy, language, authorship, trade secrecy, and patronage regulated the interactions of scholars, artisans, architects, and engineers of the early modern period.

	Her prize-winning book, Openness, Secrecy, Authorship: Technical Arts and the Culture of Knowledge from Antiquity to the Renaissance (2001), presents groundbreaking analysis of the co-evolution of artisans as writers and technological openness as an ideal in scientific inquiry. Long illustrates the complex relationship between authorship and the ownership of intellectual property; the act of authorship simultaneously makes information public—at least to those with access to the text—and asserts the author’s ownership of that information. Her second sole-authored book, Artisan/Practitioners and the Rise of the New Sciences, 1400–1600 (2011), revisits a central issue in the history of science: the influence of artisans, craftsmen, and engineers on the introduction of empirical methodologies into science. Long discards the historical framing of dichotomies—artist or scholar, practice or theory—by identifying arenas of communication and collaboration among individuals arrayed across a continuum from artisan to scholar.

	Her work in progress is a cultural history of engineering in Rome between 1557 and 1590. Long connects the humanistic study of ancient texts and artifacts by sixteenth-century Romans to their development of innovative approaches to engineering problems like flood control—a linkage not commonly recognized among historians and philosophers. In works ranging from academic treatises to booklets for a general audience, Long has changed our understanding of the artisanal and intellectual heritage of modern science.

	About Patrick's Work

	Patrick Awuah is an educator and entrepreneur building a new model for higher education in Ghana. Ashesi University, which Awuah founded in 2002, is a four-year private institution that offers a core curriculum grounded in liberal arts, ethical principles, and skills for contemporary African needs and opportunities. Awuah, a native of Ghana, was educated at American universities and began a successful career as a Microsoft engineer, but a vision for better higher education in Ghana drew him home. He saw a stark contrast between his college experience, which stressed critical thinking and problem solving, and the rote learning common in Ghana’s educational system. He was also convinced that a focus on ethical leadership in the next generation of Ghana’s leaders was the best means for combating pervasive corruption.

	Students at Ashesi choose among degree programs in business management, computer science, management information systems, and engineering. All students participate in a four-year leadership seminar on ethics, collaboration, and entrepreneurship that concludes with a service-learning component. Fostering ethical leadership is central to the university’s ethos, and in 2008, students established an honor code holding themselves responsible for ethical behavior, the first of its kind in African universities. In addition, Awuah places an emphasis on ethnic, economic, and gender diversity in the Ashesi community, and the recently opened school of engineering will focus on gender parity in its admissions.

	In a little over a decade, Ashesi is already firmly established as one of Ghana’s premier universities. Every one of its graduates has found quality employment, and almost all remain in Africa, where many have started much-needed information technology businesses. Awuah’s innovation in higher education is not only empowering individual students; it also has the potential to transform political and civil society in Ghana and other African nations by developing a new generation of leaders and entrepreneurs.

	About Paul's Work

	Paul Richards is a seismologist concerned with wave propagation in the Earth’s interior and with the practical aspects of monitoring underground nuclear explosions.

	Richards has studied several phenomena of seismic waves that required for their explanation an appreciation of unsuspected frequency-dependent effects.  He has also contributed to the understanding of earthquake sources as a phenomenon in fracture mechanics.  In 1996, Richards and a colleague discovered from seismic observations that the Earth’s inner core is rotating faster than the planet itself. This fundamental discovery opens a new window on how the Earth’s magnetic field is created and why it reverses periodically, how heat flows through the planet, and how the Earth’s multilayered interior has evolved.  He is co-author of the work, Quantitative Seismology: Theory and Methods (1980), and co-editor of Explosion Source Phenomenology (1991).

	Biography

	Richards has been the Mellon Professor of Natural Sciences at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory since 1971.  His numerous articles have appeared in such journals as Astronomy & Geophysics, Science, and Nature.

	Richards received a B.A. (1965) from the University of Cambridge, and an M.S. (1966) and Ph.D. (1970) from the California Institute of Technology.

	Paul Richards initiated and taught an undergraduate course on weapons of mass destruction at Columbia University from 2003 to 2013. He is still affiliated with Columbia and continues to conduct research on seismological methods to improve capability for monitoring explosions and earthquakes over vast areas of both continents and oceans. In particular, he works with others to achieve detection capability down to ever-smaller magnitudes and to improve the precision of estimates of the location of seismic events. He appreciates opportunities to work with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna.

	About Paul's Work

	Paul Ginsparg is a theoretical physicist widely known for creating a computer-based system for physicists and other scientists to communicate their research results. Ginsparg's document server represents a conscious effort to reorganize scientific communications, establishing a marketplace of ideas of new submissions with minimal editorial oversight and abundant opportunity for commentary, supporting and opposing, from other investigators. Ginsparg circumvented traditional funding and approval mechanisms by developing the software in his spare time and running it on surplus equipment. This system (informally known as “the xxx archive,” currently hosted at Cornell University at http://arxiv.org) provides a new, interactive mechanism for scientific communications that complements, and in some respects supplants, more traditional paper publications. All documents are available without charge worldwide through the internet, making the latest results available even for those without access to a good research library. Ginsparg has deliberately transformed the way physics gets done—challenging conventional standards for review and communication of research and thereby changing the speed and mode of dissemination of scientific advances.

	Biography

	Paul Ginsparg received his A.B. (1977) from Harvard University and a Ph.D. (1981) from Cornell University. He was a Junior Fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows (1981–1984) and a Sloan Foundation Fellow (1986–1990). Ginsparg served on the faculty of Harvard from 1984 to 1990 and on the research staff of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (1990–2001). In 2001, he accepted a faculty position at Cornell University in the Department of Physics and the Faculty of Computing and Information Science. In addition to launching the e-print archives, Ginsparg has published numerous papers in quantum field theory, string theory, conformal field theory, and quantum gravity. In 1998, he was awarded the Physics, Astronomy, and Math Award from the Special Libraries Association, and in 2000 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society.

	About Paul's Work

	Paul Wennberg is an atmospheric scientist whose work has significantly refined our understanding of natural and anthropogenic influences on the chemistry of the atmosphere. His research focuses on measuring radicals, a class of reactive intermediates found throughout the atmosphere; Wennberg’s research focuses on the upper troposphere (the layer nearest to the earth) and stratosphere (the next layer up). Chemical free radicals play a major role in the formation of ozone and greenhouse gases, but their very low concentration and inherent instability present tremendous experimental hurdles. Wennberg and colleagues have overcome these obstacles in developing advanced airborne sensors to detect these substances. Using these tools, he overturned the long-held belief that lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed principally by nitrogen oxides; Wennberg showed that odd-hydrogen catalysis represents a quantitatively more important process. By contrast to the stratosphere, a significant fraction of tropospheric ozone results from the presence of nitric oxide delivered to the atmosphere by aircraft and surface hydrocarbon burning. Ozone in the stratosphere acts as a protective shield against ultraviolet radiation, but ozone in the troposphere significantly reduces air quality. By developing methods for measuring radical gases in situ and interpreting these results within a theoretical framework, Wennberg has advanced our understanding of atmospheric chemistry.

	About Paul's Work

	Paul Rothemund is a technologist whose research focuses on the fabrication of large molecules that reliably self-assemble into complex, arbitrary, programmable shapes. His training and early research focused on DNA computation using tools borrowed from molecular biology. In the mid-1990s, others demonstrated the ability to perform specific calculations using DNA; Rothemund advanced the theory underlying these experiments by showing that it is, in principle, possible to implement arbitrarily complex computations (i.e., a universal Turing machine) using DNA along with cutting and splicing enzymes. His subsequent work focused on the potential for self-assembly to perform computations. Using experimental systems based on macroscopic plastic tiles or DNA, he demonstrated that geometric shapes that are important in computer science, such as Serpinski triangles and Penrose tiles, can be constructed by self-assembly. Most recently, he used long stretches of DNA from a virus that attacks bacteria along with carefully constructed “helper” DNA fragments to create complex, arbitrary shapes such as smiling faces or a map of the Americas. With these whimsical images, Rothemund illustrates the potential for self-assembly methods to generate large, nanoscale molecules that offer an extraordinary degree of flexibility and control over their geometry.

	Pedro Sanchez is a soil scientist whose practical and economical solutions to problems in land productivity in developing countries have established him as a leader in international agroforestry. In South America, Sanchez led a team which transformed 75 million acres of marginal land in Brazil into arable productivity, one of the largest such conversions ever. More recently, in certain regions of southern Africa with depleted soil, Sanchez pioneered the use of leguminous trees to augment soil nitrogen content naturally; when supplemented by phosphate fertilization obtained from local sources, crop yields increase from 200–400 percent. This trial project virtually eliminated reliance on costly imported chemical fertilizers for 250,000 subsistence farmers. The World Agroforestry Centre plans to extend Sanchez’ model with the objective of reaching many millions of people over the next decade. This program is particularly important in sub-Saharan Africa where people are severely vulnerable to malnutrition and starvation. Beyond immediate benefit to subsistence farmers, these and other initiatives reinforce long-term food security and environmental improvement critical to socio-economic independence in the developing world.

	About Pehr's Work

	Pehr Harbury is a biochemist who explores the structure, activity, and synthesis of proteins with the aim of developing more potent and more specific drugs for the treatment of disease. Early in his career, he focused on rational protein design, based on first-principles of amino acid structural chemistry. Most functional proteins consist of amino acid side chains attached to a protein backbone. Harbury developed a method for accurately predicting main- and side-chain structures, even for complex multimers. To demonstrate the power of his calculation, he and his colleagues synthesized proteins with unnatural, right-handed supercoiled structure and showed that they were able accurately to predict structures that had never previously existed. To improve understanding of side-chain functionality, Harbury developed an assay for testing the interaction of substrate and specific amino acids. Most recently, Harbury has introduced an efficient and effective method for using in vitro evolution to control combinatorial synthesis of small molecules. With this technique, he is able to tether to a single molecule the information needed to synthesize more of it. When combined with an instruction set many orders of magnitude larger than previous combinatorial chemical libraries and a large pool of chemical manipulations compatible with the process, Harbury's ""DNA Display"" technique promises vast increases in the speed, efficiency, and search space for the use of combinatorial chemistry in the development of new drugs.

	About Peidong's Work

	Peidong Yang is an inorganic chemist transforming the field of semiconductor nanowires and nanowire photonics and enabling wide-ranging practical applications. Nanowires are very small wires at the nano scale—so small that they behave differently, with quantum effects. Yang has led major breakthroughs in nanowire photonics over the last decade, from the initial development of nanowire lasers to the characterization of optical routing in nanowire assemblies and nanowire solar cells.

	In addition to basic research, Yang has worked toward transitioning nanowire technology into real-world applications. Technology based on his findings is now being demonstrated in commercial devices for the conversion of waste heat into electricity, in chemical sensors, and in optical switches. Yang’s current research also focuses on artificial photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants gather sunlight and carbon dioxide from the air, combine them with water, and store energy in chemical compounds; previous attempts to replicate it as a means for converting solar energy into fuel have not been efficient enough for commercial use.

	Yang and his collaborators have created a synthetic “leaf” that is a hybrid system of semiconducting nanowires and bacteria. The nanowires gather sunlight, and the bacteria trigger the use of carbon dioxide and water to complete the photosynthetic process and produce a targeted carbon-based chemical such as butanol. The team’s recent breakthrough in synthesizing carbon dioxide into methane, the primary component of natural gas, exhibits the potential to convert solar energy with an efficiency that makes it viable for commercial use. Yang’s advances in the science of nanomaterials are opening new horizons for tackling the global challenge of clean, renewable energy sources.

	Peter Cole is a translator, publisher, and poet who brings the often overlooked works of medieval Spain and the modern Middle East to English-speaking audiences. His highly regarded translations of the poetry of Solomon Ibn Gabirol and Shmuel HaNagid, two of the great Hebrew poets of the Andalusian “Golden Age,” offer readers a lyrical illustration of the extraordinary Arab-Jewish cultural partnership that flourished in tenth- through twelfth-century Spain. A poet himself, Cole’s translations infuse medieval verse with contemporary meaning while remaining faithful to the original text. His renderings of HaNagid’s poems in particular, long regarded as “untranslatable,” retain the subtleties, complexities, and formal elegance of the original verse. Underlying Cole’s translations is an implicit message of cultural and historical cross-fertilization that is also evident in his work as a poet and a publisher. His Ibis Editions publishes little-known works translated from Arabic, Hebrew, German, French, and Ladino, enlightening English-speaking audiences to the thriving literary tradition of the Levant. By fostering literary dialogue in and about the Middle East, Ibis provides an occasion for intellectual and cultural collaboration. In a region mired in conflict, Cole’s dedication to the literature of the Levant offers a unique and inspiring vision of the cultural, religious, and linguistic interactions that were and are possible among the peoples of the Middle East.

	About Peter's Work

	Peter Kenmore is an entomologist specializing in integrated pest management.

	He has been influential in the reduction of pesticide use on rice crops in Asia, and thus, has had an impact on world food production and on concepts of sustainable development.  Working with the United Nations in Asia, Kenmore has studied the population dynamics of insect pests and their natural enemies to determine how these balances are affected by insecticides.  He has developed new strategies for protecting major food crops from pests while reducing pesticide use, and has established farmers’ field schools where these methods are taught to rural farmers.  His model has been widely adopted by rice farmers in Asia, and its success has led several governments to stop or reduce subsidies for unrestricted, pesticide use on rice crops.

	About Peter's Work

	Peter Gleick is a conservation analyst and a leader in efforts to underscore the importance and finite nature of global fresh water resources. While water policy is typically considered in many contexts, each tends to be limited in scope: human consumption, ecological habitat, irrigation, power generation, etc. Gleick brings to these considerations a synthetic approach, highlighting the interdependence of security, health, environment, and economic development and the place of water as critical nexus between and among these key sectors. Gleick is a founder of the Pacific Institute, a center for research and policy on water and climate change. He and the Institute serve regularly as thoughtful and reliable sources for scientific analyses on policy issues related to water, water availability, water quality and water needs in the interest of global security, development and the environment. He publishes The World’s Water, a biennial review of data critical to fresh water analyses. He maintains a project studying the role water has played, past and present, in shaping international conflict. He regularly analyzes policy proposals and decisions, consistently addressing the current politics of water with its emphases on creating new water supplies (e.g., dam construction) over decreasing consumption and more efficient uses of existing resources. Throughout, Gleick argues that access to sufficient quality and quantity of water is a basic right, an essential consideration at the core of local, national, and international fresh water policy. By defragmenting the social, political, economic, and environmental considerations determining water resource development and allocation, Gleick has established a standard and a framework for water policy decisions today and in the future.

	About Peter's Work

	Peter Hessler is a long-form journalist whose three books and numerous magazine articles explore the complexities of life in Reform Era China as it undergoes one of the fastest social transformations in history. Drawing upon a decade-long immersion in Chinese culture as well as extensive travels and historical research, Hessler writes with a novelist's attention to detail and structures his stories around the compelling characters he encounters. Offering Anglophone readers perspectives on China that delve well beyond those of standard news coverage, he provides moving and keenly observed accounts of how ordinary people — ranging from students to farmers to engineers and entrepreneurs — respond to rapidly shifting opportunities and constraints. His first book, River Town (2001), chronicles his experiences teaching in the remote province of Sichuan, in a small city about to be flooded by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. In Oracle Bones (2006), Hessler expands upon shorter articles originally published in the New Yorker, juxtaposing portraits of several different Chinese lives to discern larger themes in the manner of an archaeologist arranging and interpreting fragments from the past. The personal stories he recounts include those of a migrant factory worker, a Uighur money-trader seeking political asylum in the United States, and a scholar of oracle bone inscriptions, an early form of Chinese writing. Hessler's third book, Country Driving (2010), investigates the effects of China's auto boom on regions ranging from all-but-abandoned rural villages to expanding industrial centers. With recent pieces focused on other locales and subjects, such as the American Southwest and a Peace Corps project in Nepal, he continues to weave multiple narrative threads into richly illuminating depictions of people and places confronted with a staggering pace of change.

	About Peter's Work

	Peter Huybers is a climate scientist who, by mining the wealth of often-conflicting experimental observations, has developed several influential theories that explain global climate change on various time scales. Much of his research focuses on the Pleistocene, which spans from about 1.8 million years ago to the end of the most recent ice age, some 12,000 years ago. Drawing on physics, statistics, and mathematical modeling, Huybers showed that the long-recognized periodic glaciation of about 100,000 years could be explained mainly by obliquity — changes in the angle of the Earth’s axis in a 40,000-year period — rather than its orbital shape or precession. Testing a large number of models, he noted that, if the obliquity cycle triggers glaciation randomly after either 80,000 or 120,000 years, the average result is glaciation approximately every 100,000 years. The underlying physical mechanism explaining this phenomenon is likely the variability in the amount of energy received from the sun (insolation) at various latitudes in the summer. On much shorter time scales, a similar mechanism accounts for temperature variation through the seasons. Huybers has used analogous physical principles and observations of recent conditions to build simple models of land-ocean-atmosphere dynamics to explain changes in land ice on the scale of years or decades. For example, he has developed evidence that deglaciation tends to precede increased volcanism, suggesting that the weight of overlaying ice may directly influence mantle geophysics. Through his imaginative yet simple interpretations of fundamental questions in climatology, geology, and oceanography, Huybers is advancing our understanding of both past and ongoing climate change.

	About Peter's Work

	Peter Bickel is a statistician who has worked on the development and mathematical analysis of statistical procedures in what have become known as semiparametric models.

	These models appear frequently in contexts ranging from the biomedical sciences, through economics, to astronomy and various areas of engineering.  His analyses have been driven by considerations of efficiency and robustness.  With Chris Klaassen, Ya’acov Ritov, and Jon Wellner, he produced a major monograph entitled Efficient and Adaptive Estimation in Semiparametric Models (1993).  More recently, he has pursued specific substantive questions into which semiparametric models can yield insight, including the genomics of HIV, travel time forecasting, and the distinctions between linear and nonlinear stochastic and deterministic phenomena in time series.

	Bickel received an A.B. (1960), M.A. (1961), and Ph.D. (1963) from the University of California, Berkeley.

	Recent News

	In recent years, Peter Bickel has followed an old interest in biology, developing models useful in large-scale biological data analysis. He became head of the only statistical group associated with the ENCODE1 and 2 projects. ENCODE stands for Encyclopaedia of DNA, a National Institutes of Health endeavor involving labs across the world. The goal of the project was no less than the identification of all functional elements in the human genome. While this was not achieved, enormous bodies of data were generated that established that things were far more complicated than was originally anticipated. Bickel’s group made a major contribution to these efforts with an approach called the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR), which is used as a way of ensuring uniformity of quality of a number of assays based on determining the consistency of the same assay on a pair of biological replicates.

	Peter Pronovost is a critical care physician who devises life-saving clinical practices that are dramatically improving patient safety in hospitals across the United States. Both a clinician and an academic researcher, he takes scientific evidence to the bedside and motivates health care professionals in large health systems — including hospital CEOs, intensive care specialists, residents, nurses, and other health care staff — to change the culture of their institutions in the interest of reducing the risk of medical errors and hospital-acquired infections. One of his most notable contributions to date resulted from his focus on bloodstream infections from central venous catheters used in intensive care units (ICUs). To address this all-too-common problem, responsible for thousands of deaths each year, Pronovost culled lengthy guidelines into a simple checklist of five precautionary steps and tested its efficacy through a cohort study conducted in ICUs throughout the state of Michigan. Pronovost’s checklist intervention yielded a significant and sizable decrease in rates of infection and is currently being replicated by hospitals across the U.S. and Europe. Other projects under way include the development of a web-based ICU safety reporting system, methods for minimizing the incidence of aspiration pneumonia and acute lung injury in patients receiving ventilator assistance, and quality care measures for patients suffering from severe sepsis. By rigorously evaluating and skillfully implementing effective safety procedures, Pronovost is sparing countless lives from the often deadly consequences of human error and setting new standards of health care performance in the United States and internationally.

	Peter Shor is a computer scientist who is helping to shape the field of quantum computing.

	Using tools from physics, computation, and information theory, his discoveries offer the possibility of an exponential increase in the speed of an important class of calculations. In one recent proof, Shor demonstrated that quantum uncertainty can be harnessed to calculate prime factors of integers substantially faster than any known algorithm based on digital logic. This proof opens opportunities for future advances in number theory and exposes an unexpected vulnerability of computer cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring to provide its protection. Shor expanded this theoretical work by providing important clues to practical implementation. He explained how the counterintuitive phenomenon of entanglement can be used to observe the behavior of a quantum computer without affecting its calculations, an essential feature that any working, quantum computer must possess. He also showed how specific methods of encoding information decrease a quantum computer's sensitivity to noise or other imperfections.

	Phil Baran is an organic chemist recreating pharmacologically interesting compounds isolated from natural sources de novo in the laboratory through an experimental methodology known as “total synthesis.” In nature, complex molecules are synthesized in catalytic pathways that have evolved incrementally over millions of years, but many cannot be harvested in sufficient quantities to provide viable pharmaceutical solutions. Baran has invented new approaches to synthesizing natural products en masse, offering solutions for the cost and supply problems in drug development and creating alternative methods for obtaining industrial quantities of biologically active compounds with minimal environmental impact.

	Working across a broad spectrum of chemistry—from indole alkaloids to terpenes—he has devised ingeniously concise routes to notoriously challenging target molecules that are of great utility for pharmaceutical applications spanning antibacterial, antiviral, and tumor-inhibiting activity. More recently, he developed an affordable, elegant method for synthesizing cortistatin A, an unusual, marine-derived steroidal alkaloid that has shown strong potential in treating conditions ranging from macular degeneration to cancer due to its antiangiogenesis properties.

	Baran has also devised a scalable and more economical route to synthesis of ouabagenin, a steroid indicated for the treatment of congestive heart failure, enabling broader use of a treatment option whose production costs put it out of reach for most patients. Baran’s research is not only enhancing our ability to make fundamental structures for a broad range of medicines and materials, but is also strengthening the intellectual foundations of organic chemistry.

	About Rachel's Work

	Rachel Wilson is a young neurobiologist who has expanded on her initial training in neuropharmacology to develop a systems-level approach to understanding sensory physiology. In early work, she focused on the activity of nonclassical neurotransmitters in the mammalian hippocampus, a structure associated with long-term memory. A key question in memory formation is how the activity of target neurons influences the strength of its synaptic inputs; Wilson used electrophysiologic measurements to show that receptors for a class of neurotransmitters, endocannabinoids, play a key role in modulating inhibitory inputs in neurons associated with learning. More recently, she has taken on the challenge of understanding how the brain distinguishes different smells. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, primary olfactory neurons specialize in detecting single odorant types; the task of integrating their information for higher-order processing falls to a single level of intermediate neurons. Wilson has developed sophisticated techniques for measuring the activity of these neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila. She has found that their activity can range from highly specialized to quite general. Since types of smells vary across many more dimensions than physical senses of light or sound, determining the neural activity patterns in olfaction represents an important step in sensory physiology and may serve as a template for understanding other more abstract forms of neural representation, such as speech recognition or color. By developing experimental models that integrate electrophysiology, neuropharmacology, molecular genetics, functional anatomy, and behavior, Wilson opens new avenues for exploring a central issue in neurobiology — how neural circuits are organized to sense and react to a complex environment.

	About Rackstaw's Work

	Rackstraw Downes is a painter whose minutely detailed, oil-on-canvas landscapes invite viewers to reconsider the intersection between the natural world and man-made objects. Turning from abstract painting in the early 1960s, Downes has pursued a unique approach to realism that defies standard categorization. He begins each work with drawings and oil sketches before it is meticulously painted on site; in order to capture the precise details of lighting and weather, he can spend many months completing a single piece. Rejecting picturesque views characteristic of much realist work, his landscapes depict scenes generally overlooked or dismissed for lack of a traditional aesthetic appeal. His subjects range from the roadways, urban detritus, and industrial backyards of the East Coast to the oil fields and vast, empty terrain of Texas. In painting the American landscape as it is, not as it has been idealized, Downes imbues seemingly ordinary subjects with extraordinary power. His artistry is deeply rooted in the history and thought of painting, and he has written highly regarded essays on visual and literary artists as varied as John Constable, Fairfield Porter, and Samuel Beckett. Considered one of the most distinctive representational painters of his generation, Downes is challenging familiar conceptions of realist painting in works of formal rigor and quiet, yet stunning, beauty.

	About Raj's Work

	Raj Chetty is an economist whose rigorous theoretical and empirical studies are informing the design of effective government policy.  His initial work focused on resolving inconsistencies in earlier theories of specific questions in public finance, such as how dividend tax cuts affect corporate behavior and how unemployment insurance affects job-seeking behavior. More recently, he and colleagues designed novel empirical tests to gauge the impact of sales taxes on demand. In a study at a large supermarket chain, they demonstrated that, although most customers were well-informed about the retail sales tax rates, consumers purchased less of a product when posted prices indicated the associated sales tax than when the tax was simply added to the product’s base price at checkout. This observation, suggesting that the way in which a tax is perceived can have as much or more impact on consumer decision making as the tax itself, is an important contribution to the emerging field of behavioral public finance. Using large administrative databases drawn from tax and social security records in the United States and Europe, Chetty currently is exploring a range of other questions, such as the effect of tax policy on how much people work, the extent to which tax deductions for retirement savings stimulate individual savings, and key aspects of early childhood education. In a study on teacher quality using these data sets and information gleaned from school district databases, Chetty and colleagues found that, adjusting for other factors, students who by chance were assigned to talented teachers in elementary school had significantly higher incomes as adults and better future life outcomes more generally. By asking simple, penetrating questions and developing rigorous theoretical and empirical tests, Chetty’s timely, often surprising, findings in applied economics are illuminating key policy issues of our time.

	About Raj's Work 

	Raj Jayadev is a community organizer creating a model of grassroots collective action that gives individuals facing incarceration, their families, and their communities an active role in their defense. Jayadev’s work in criminal justice reform has grown out of his social activism work with Silicon Valley De-Bug (De-Bug), an organization he co-founded in 2001. De-Bug began as a magazine about issues affecting low-wage manufacturing, temporary workers, and it has since evolved into a multidimensional platform for community organizing, social justice advocacy, and multimedia storytelling by low-income, minority, incarcerated, and other disenfranchised communities.

	De-Bug’s most notable initiative is the Albert Cobarrubias Justice Project (ACJP) and its “participatory defense” model. Participatory defense adapts community organizing principles to criminal justice reform; it brings together a network of community members to help families navigate a complex criminal justice system and to enable chronically under-resourced public defenders to more effectively defend their clients. Participants assist in the case discovery process, review allegations and evidence, and help construct humanizing personal biographies and videos of defendants. The practical support for attorneys and empowerment conferred on defendants and their families through participatory defense often prevents individuals from taking plea bargains out of ignorance or expediency. Former defendants and their family members often continue to volunteer with ACJP at the conclusion of their cases, using the knowledge they gained to assist and advocate for other families. 

	Participatory defense is now spreading beyond California. Hubs have been established in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Tennessee as part of the National Participatory Defense Network, and Jayadev is conducting training workshops in communities across the United States. Collectively, the hubs have saved nearly 4,000 years of potential prison terms for defendants through cases won or reduced sentences. De-Bug is also expanding its advocacy efforts for systems-level change in the justice system, engaging in campaigns around bail reform, sentencing reform, and police accountability. By empowering ordinary people to take collective action in the defense of low-income individuals, Jayadev is addressing a critical issue in criminal justice reform—the imbalance of power between prosecutors and overworked public defenders.

	About Rami's Work

	Rami Nashashibi is a community leader building bridges across racial, religious, and socioeconomic divides to confront the challenges of poverty and disinvestment in urban communities. His experience as a Palestinian-American Muslim, his training as a sociologist, and his skills as a community organizer inform his role as executive director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network (IMAN). IMAN is headquartered on Chicago's South Side, in the ethnically and religiously diverse working-class neighborhood of Marquette Park, which has struggled with high rates of foreclosure, unemployment, and gang violence over the past several decades. Supporting IMAN's initiatives and services for vulnerable South Side residents is a unique coalition of typically disparate constituencies—most notably, African American Muslims and Muslim immigrant communities in both low-income urban areas and wealthier suburbs—that Nashashibi has unified around a shared focus on social justice.

	IMAN's numerous programs include a community clinic that provides primary health care and behavioral health services to a largely uninsured and underinsured population and a job training initiative that equips formerly incarcerated individuals with green construction skills through the renovation of foreclosed homes. Nashashibi also launched the Muslim Run Corner Store Campaign, a program that aims to make fresh, healthy foods more readily available in underserved neighborhoods, develop alternative business models for food and liquor stores, and heal the racial tensions between store owners (who are often Arab immigrants) and patrons (who are predominantly black). To further promote cross-cultural dialogue and celebrate wide-ranging forms of artistic expression, including hip-hop, Sufi Qawwali singing, spoken-word, and soul, IMAN produces a vibrant arts and social justice festival, Takin' It to the Streets, that attracts an audience of thousands to the heart of Marquette Park. More recently, IMAN began hosting weekly Grassroots Power Hour sessions, which offer local residents a space to discuss their needs in relation to shifting immigration and criminal justice policies with legal experts, behavioral health staff, community organizers, and one another.

	Nashashibi's practical approach to addressing social justice issues at the local level in Chicago neighborhoods has informed and inspired Muslim American civic engagement efforts in cities from Los Angeles to Atlanta, where a new chapter of IMAN recently opened. He is countering xenophobic misperceptions of immigrants with a powerful example of Muslim-led community activism and demonstrating how Islamic spiritual ideals enrich American culture.

	About Rebecca's Work

	Rebecca Onie is a public health entrepreneur building a low-cost, replicable model that melds the aspirations of college students and the unmet needs of health care institutions to address the link between poverty and poor health. Project HEALTH, which she co-founded while a college sophomore, is designed to overcome the barriers for low-income families to good health outcomes that are often the result of apparently unrelated constraints, such as child care, transportation, housing, food, education, and legal advocacy. Onie recognized that health care providers are neither trained to diagnose nor have the tools to address the socioeconomic ills that contribute to poor health. Committed to a concept of a health care system that systematically addresses all patient needs, she created a program that works in concert with hospitals and physician mentors to mobilize college students to assist patients in overcoming obstacles limiting their access to health care. By deploying college students to Family Health Desks in clinics throughout the country, Project HEALTH enables these clinics to establish new protocols for routinely screening and addressing patients’ unmet resource needs. Equally important, by providing volunteers with direct experience of the relationship between health and poverty, the program has created a generation of young people committed to improving health care delivery in their future careers. Founded on one campus in one city, Project HEALTH now has hundreds of volunteers helping thousands of families each year at pediatric sites in Boston, Providence, New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. Continually refining the Project HEALTH model for new challenges and local conditions, Onie is providing health care professionals with effective tools for alleviating the socioeconomic barriers that limit access to health care for low-income families, thereby expanding the scope of what health care truly entails.

	Biography

	Rebecca Onie received a B.A. (1997) and J.D. (2003) from Harvard University. With Dr. Barry Zuckerman, she co-founded Project HEALTH in 1996 and served as executive director until 1999. After attending law school, she was an associate at Miner, Barnhill, and Galland P.C. from 2003 to 2005, before returning to Project HEALTH as CEO in 2006.

	Recent News

	Rebecca Onie has continued in her position as co-founder and CEO of Project HEALTH, guiding the organization through a name change, to Health Leads, and expansion. In 2014, Health Leads served over 13,500 patients and their families in 7 cities across the country. As a service provider, Health Leads is helping health systems to create models for integrating patient social needs into care, using a full spectrum of tools, including the Health Leads’ Desk, in which providers “prescribe” basic resources like food and heat, and well-trained student advocates stationed in the clinics work side-by-side with patients to “fill” those prescriptions by accessing community resources and public benefits. More recently, Health Leads has been piloting new solutions (including technology, training, and implementation insights) that will enable healthcare organizations to address social needs in a range of care settings and with a variety of workforces. In addition to its work as a service provider, Health Leads works with health systems at the leadership level to build momentum in the sector for addressing patient social needs. In this role, Health Leads shines a light on innovation and best practices and participates in critical efforts around evaluation and value measurement.

	About Rebecca's Work

	Rebecca Richards-Kortum is a bioengineer addressing global health disparities in low-resource settings by developing point-of-care medical technologies and a new approach to engineering education. Drawing from nanotechnology, molecular imaging, and microfabrication techniques, Richards-Kortum has created numerous low-cost and highly practical medical tools. For example, she and collaborators have invented methods for diagnosis of oral, esophageal, and cervical cancers that overcome the challenges posed by invasive biopsies and multiple follow-up appointments in developing countries. A portable, high-resolution microendoscope enables real-time diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer in a single visit, and topical application of novel optically active contrast agents sharpens the image contrast between normal and precancerous oral tissue.

	Richards-Kortum spends significant time working directly with hospitals, community groups, and rural practitioners in Malawi, Rwanda, El Salvador, Brazil, and elsewhere to ensure her inventions are robust and reliable in local settings. These visits also enable her to identify needs, evaluate the impact of proposed solutions, and gather feedback for improvements. In addition to her own research, Richards-Kortum co-founded Beyond Traditional Borders (BTB), an undergraduate curriculum focused on translating classroom concepts into solutions for global health problems. The curriculum includes coursework in engineering, sociology, psychology, and economics, while a capstone project challenges students to work in multidisciplinary teams to build a technology that responds to a global health need.

	New medical technologies created by BTB students include an LED-based phototherapy light for treating jaundice in newborns that can be made for less than $100, and a bubble continuous positive airway pressure machine (bCPAP) for premature infants unable to breathe on their own. The bCPAP decreased mortality rates in a Malawi neonatal ward by 46 percent at a cost of nearly 38 times lower than the standard model. Committed to improving access to quality health care for all the world’s people, Richards-Kortum is not only developing novel solutions but also training and inspiring the next generation of engineers and scientists to address our shared global challenges.

	About Rebecca's Work 

	Rebecca Sandefur is a sociologist whose research on how legal services are delivered and consumed is informing emerging models for more equal access to civil justice. Although the outcomes of civil cases are potentially life-changing—including eviction, loss of custody of a child, wage garnishment, or loss of government or insurance benefits—one or more parties lack legal representation in more than three-quarters of cases filed in state civil courts today. Sandefur’s investigations of the civil justice needs of low-income populations are shedding light on the availability of civil legal aid services, the help-seeking behavior of individuals facing civil legal issues, and the impact of lawyers in civil cases.

	Using quantitative and qualitative research methodologies such as surveys and focus groups, she created the first systematic national mapping of civil legal aid providers, revealing that while some states had significant resources available, others had very few. She found that contrary to assumptions, cost is but one of many factors that inhibit the use of lawyers by low-income individuals. Other factors include aversion to lawyers, fear and pessimism about the fairness of formal legal structures and the courts, and a lack of recognition that a problem is “legal.” Her analysis of pro bono services revealed that the quantity and quality are highly dependent on market forces, and they become less available in economic downturns, when they are most needed. From a meta-analysis of research on lawyers’ effects on case outcomes, Sandefur concludes that, in most cases, the advantage of a lawyer relative to a lay person resides in an ability to navigate procedures and rules rather than in deep knowledge of the law. Her observations have led to the hypothesis that the gap in access to civil justice might be closable without lawyers and, in current work, Sandefur is advising and evaluating pilot projects in New York and Montana that use non-lawyer alternatives. For example, in New York City, she demonstrated the efficacy of non-lawyer court “navigators” in landlord-tenant housing court. She is also regularly sought out by national and international organizations regarding access to justice issues, and she is a central contributor to the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) new global program on access to justice.

	By bridging legal scholarship and practice, Sandefur is providing the empirical evidence necessary to guide and implement wide-scale reforms to address the civil legal needs of low-income people.

	About Regina's Work

	Regina Barzilay is a computational linguist developing machine learning methods that enable computers to interpret unstructured document content and perform real-world tasks with the promise for significant societal impact.

	Barzilay has made significant contributions to a wide range of problems in computational linguistics, including both interpretation and generation of human language. Much of her work is focused on designing machine learning models that do not require large amounts of annotations for training since such resources are not available for most languages and tasks. In the multilingual context, Barzilay created algorithms that leverage annotations from high-resource languages (i.e., such as English) to analyze languages that lack such annotations; this includes the vast majority of world languages. For example, she and a student deciphered the ancient semitic language Ugaritic by mapping cognates and related morphological structures onto the related Hebrew language. This work not only democratizes natural language processing (NLP) by extending its potential benefits to a wider range of languages, it also yields insights for theories of language universals. Jointly with her students, Barzilay also pioneered the development of reinforcement learning methods for language grounding—that is, mapping language to entities and actions in the world. Through a feedback loop, the program learns in an unsupervised, coordinated way, allowing it to interact with the environment based on its understanding, continuously refine its semantic model, and turn the instructions into executable actions. This technique has been demonstrated to work with a high degree of accuracy in tasks such as configuring computer software using text manuals and in improving computer performance in the strategy game Civilization.

	Currently, Barzilay is focused on bringing the power of machine learning to oncology. In collaboration with physicians and her students, she is devising deep learning models that utilize imaging, free text, and structured data to identify trends that affect early diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention. Barzilay is poised to play a leading role in creating new models that advance the capacity of computers to harness the power of human language data.

	Regina Carter is a master of improvisational jazz violin. Though her work draws upon a wide range of musical influences — including Motown, Afro-Cuban, swing, bebop, folk and world music — she has crafted a signature voice and style. In jazz, bowed string instruments such as the violin are not traditionally featured in the solo role; Carter’s performances highlight the often overlooked potential of the jazz violin for its lyric, melodic, and percussive potential. Her early training as a classical musician is reflected in the fluidity, grace, and balance of her performance.  Carter’s repertoire retains a firm connection with the familiar while venturing in new, unexpected directions. On recordings such as Motor City Moments (2000), where she overlays swing with a soulful sound, and Freefall (2001), a collaboration with jazz legend Kenny Barron, Carter taps into a broad musical vocabulary to weave new sound tapestries. In live performances with jazz veterans and in ensembles, she captivates her audience with the passion and spirit of adventure intrinsic to her approach to music. Through artistry with an instrument that has been defined predominantly by the classical tradition, Carter is pioneering new possibilities for the violin and for jazz.

	About Reginald's Work

	Reginald R. Robinson is a musician and composer who chose an unusual path for his musical career: classical ragtime music. An early 20th century American musical form characterized by a syncopated melody, ragtime was advocated by composers such as Scott Joplin as a uniquely American music that would change and evolve with the succeeding years. Introduced to ragtime through an elementary school presentation, Robinson taught himself to play the piano and to read music and began researching the genre. He has remained dedicated to the form ever since. A gifted pianist, he evokes the range of passion and liveliness contained within the classic ragtime compositions of the early 1900s. He has explored in detail the great works of Scott Joplin, Eubie Blake, and other classical ragtime composers and has composed dozens of harmonically daring, structurally complex works. In addition to his composition and performance, Robinson has studied the history of ragtime music thoroughly; he discovered and recorded a previously unknown Joplin fragment found in the archives of Fisk University. This singular musician has devoted himself to preserving the traditions of classical ragtime while taking this vintage music into contemporary directions.

	About Rhiannon's Work

	Rhiannon Giddens is a singer, instrumentalist, and songwriter enriching our understanding of American music by reclaiming African American contributions to folk and country genres and revealing affinities between a range of musical traditions, from gospel and Celtic to jazz and R&B.

	In her recordings and live performances, Giddens has mined the history of the African American string band tradition, introducing new audiences to the black banjoists and fiddlers whose influences have been left out of popular narratives of the lineage of folk and country music. Giddens is a native of the Piedmont region of North Carolina, and she trained as an opera singer before returning to North Carolina to immerse herself in traditional American roots music through study of archival recordings and the mentorship of the octogenarian fiddler Joe Thompson. Having honed her skills on the fiddle and 5-string banjo, she co-founded with two other bandmates the Carolina Chocolate Drops in order to share this tradition with a new generation of listeners. More recently, Giddens has released two solo albums. Tomorrow Is My Turn (2015) offers riveting interpretations of songs that were written or made famous by women, spanning folk, bluegrass, country, gospel, jazz, Celtic, and other genres. Freedom Highway (2017) consists mainly of original compositions by Giddens, and the album traverses the experience of African Americans from slavery to the present. Drawing inspiration from slave narratives, early twentieth-century songwriters such as Mississippi John Hurt, and even a rap about police violence written by her nephew, Freedom Highway is at once a recuperation of suppressed voices and a history lesson.

	With extraordinary vocal abilities and emotional range afforded by her classical training, Giddens is a powerful presence on stage, and her explanations of the historical and social contexts for the music she performs further demonstrate how discrete musical approaches can inform one another. Giddens's drive to understand and convey the nuances, complexities, and interrelationships between musical traditions is enhancing our musical present with a wealth of sounds and textures from the past.

	Their work explores how space functions in our culture and illustrates that architecture, when understood as the physical manifestation of social relationships, is everywhere, not just in buildings. “We Interrupt This Program” is a collaborative proposal commissioned by CNN for the atrium of its headquarters in Atlanta. “Cold War” proposes to use an ice hockey rink as a video-projection surface for computer-animated videos. Recent projects include an expansion of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and collaboration on the design of a public park plan for the High Line, a 1.6 mile elevated railroad platform on Manhattan’s West Side. In 2003, the Whitney Museum hosted Scanning: The Aberrant Architecture of Diller + Scofidio, their first major retrospective exhibition.

	Biography

	Scofidio has been a professor of architecture at Cooper Union School since 1965. He also serves as principal of the firm of Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which he co-founded in 1979. Diller and Scofidio published Flesh: Architectural Probes (1995) and Blur: The Making of Nothing (2002).

	Born in 1935, Scofidio studied at The Cooper Union School of Architecture (1952-55) and received a B.Arch. (1960) from Columbia University.

	About Richard's Work

	Richard Muller is a physicist and an inventor whose contributions are both experimental and theoretical.

	His experimental work on cosmic radiation from the origin of the universe provided the first direct measurement of the velocity of the earth.  He invented Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, the most sensitive method of detecting low levels of radioactivity and of dating samples for archaeology and geology.  He and his group at Berkeley have built a system for the identification of astrophysical phenomena.  As a result, they have discovered numerous supernovae.  Based on an observed periodicity in mass extinctions of species on Earth, his work predicted the existence of a small star orbiting the sun, which he calls Nemesis. Muller is the author of several books including Nemesis (1988), The Three Big Bangs (1996), and Ice Ages and Astronomical Causes (2000).

	About Richard's Work

	Richard Prum is an ornithologist who draws from a wide spectrum of disciplines, including developmental biology, optical physics, molecular genetics, phylogenetics, paleontology, and behavior ecology, to address central questions about bird development, evolution, and behavior. Through careful study of the morphology and molecular control of feather development, Prum deduced a five-step sequence of genetic adaptations that plausibly accounts for the evolution of contemporary feather structure. This theory ties bird origins closely to a group of dinosaurs known as therapods and contrasts with an alternative hypothesis of feather derivation from modified reptile scales. Subsequent discoveries in the fossil record have supported his theory. He has also devoted much attention to the mechanisms of color production in feathers. Collaborating with applied mathematicians, Prum demonstrated that the blue coloration in feathers is due to coherent light scatter (rather than pigmentation), a finding that applies to some other species such as certain butterflies and reptiles as well. Though much of his work centers on feathers, he also employs his expertise in avian anatomy to examine, for example, the relationship between vocal apparatus morphology and bird song behavior. Through careful fieldwork, he has gathered promising evidence that phylogenetic relationships among bird species can be inferred or substantiated by comparative behavioral studies. Whatever the phenomenon under study, Prum habitually synthesizes concepts from disparate fields and follows surprising paths to reach carefully reasoned conclusions. His research to date raises the profile of ornithological studies in several fundamental aspects of biology, and he continues to open new frontiers with each subsequent project.

	About Rick's Work

	Rick Lowe is an artist whose unconventional approach to community revitalization has transformed a long-neglected neighborhood in Houston into a visionary public art project that continues to evolve, two decades since its inception. Originally trained as a painter, Lowe shifted the focus of his artistic practice in the early 1990s in order to address more directly the pressing social, economic, and cultural needs of his community. With a group of fellow artists, he organized the purchase and restoration of a block and a half of derelict properties—twenty-two shotgun houses from the 1930s—in Houston’s predominantly African American Third Ward and turned them into Project Row Houses (PRH), an unusual amalgam of arts venue and community support center.

	Since its founding in 1993, PRH has served as a vital anchor for what had been a fast-eroding neighborhood, providing arts education programs for youth, exhibition spaces and studio residencies for emerging and established artists, a residential mentorship program for young mothers, an organic gardening program, and an incubator for historically appropriate designs for low-income housing on land surrounding the original row houses. While inviting constant collaboration with local residents, artists, church groups, architects, and urban planners, Lowe continues to provide the guiding vision for PRH as he pursues his overarching goal of animating the assets of a place and the creativity of its people. He is not only bringing visibility and pride to the Third Ward by celebrating the beauty of its iconic shotgun houses; he is also changing the lives of many PRH program graduates and expanding the PRH campus to cover a six-block area in an effort to preserve the historic district’s character in the face of encroaching gentrification.

	Lowe has initiated similarly arts-driven redevelopment projects in other cities, including the Watts House Project in Los Angeles, a post-Katrina rebuilding effort in New Orleans, and, most recently, a vibrant community market in a densely populated, immigrant neighborhood in North Dallas. Lowe’s pioneering “social sculptures” have inspired a generation of artists to explore more socially engaged forms of art-making in communities across the country.

He is currently the artist-in-residence at the Nasher Sculpture Center and a Mel King Community Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his work has been exhibited at such national and international venues as Houston’s Contemporary Arts Museum and Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Gwangju Biennale in South Korea, and the Venice Architecture Biennale.

	Robert Sapolsky is a neuroendocrinologist who examines the mechanisms by which stress can damage the brain.

	His work focuses on the ability of glucocorticoids, a class of hormones secreted during stress, to damage neurons of the hippocampus, an area of the brain critical to learning and memory.  Having shown that glucocorticoids can damage the hippocampus in both rodents and primates, Sapolsky is investigating the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.  His studies examine whether or not the same occurs in the hippocampus of the human brain, with potential implications for neurogerontology and Alzheimer’s disease.  Since 1978, Sapolsky has spent part of each year studying a troop of wild baboons in an East African national reserve.  His findings suggest that personality is a more important correlate of disease patterns than social rank.  He is the author of Stress, the Aging Brain, and the Mechanisms of Neuron Death (1992), Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers: A Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping (3rd ed., 2004), and The Trouble with Testosterone: And Other Essays on the Biology of the Human Predicament (1997).

	About Robert's Work

	Robert Shapley is a visual neurophysiologist who studies the relationship between visual perception and the activity of single neurons and neural networks in the brain.

	Shapley investigates the visual pathways of the brain as a communication system, using the tools of systems analysis and communication theory.  His experiments have revealed a functional specialization in the neurons along the visual pathway from eye to brain.  He discovered that two neural pathways, now labeled P and M, which carry signals from retina to cerebral cortex, differ in their sensitivity to contrast.  Shapley’s current work concerns the neural basis of perception of form.  He is studying the dynamics of the formation of illusory contours, and the dynamics of neural responses in the visual cortex.  He is the editor of Contrast Sensitivity (1993), and his numerous articles have appeared in such publications as Neuron and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA.

	Robert Shapley continues his research on the visual cortex and visual perceptions. His lab’s ultimate goals are to relate neuronal activity in the visual cortex to visual perception and to use V1 as a model system that reveals fundamental processes of the cerebral cortex. Building realistic neural network models of the cortex is important for reaching the second goal, and the best model he and colleagues have developed is a recurrent excitatory and inhibitory network. The model needs strong cortical inhibition to explain many phenomena in the visual cortex, for instance, the existence of simple and complex cells, orientation selectivity and the correlation of orientation selectivity with other feature selectivities, and spectral peaks in the cortical local field potential.

	About Robin's Work

	Robin Fleming is a historian enriching our knowledge of life in Britain in the tumultuous centuries during and after the fall of the Roman Empire through an artful blending of archaeological and textual sources. In scholarship encompassing the end of the Roman occupation, the appearance of Germanic settlements, the conversion to Christianity, and the viking raids on Britain, Fleming supplements the fragmentary and elite-focused written record with comprehensive consideration of material evidence unearthed by archaeologists.

	Drawing on physical remains as well as objects including brooches, buckles, coins, potsherds, and spears found in medieval cemeteries and settlements, Fleming is able to illuminate the everyday existence of the largely illiterate lower-elite and peasant classes. Her account of the early medieval period in Britain after Rome: The Fall and Rise of the Middle Ages, c. 400–1070 (2010) brings to life the way people traded, worshipped, and commemorated their dead while also revealing the impact of repeated resettlement and urbanization.

	Her recent work focuses on the centuries of economic collapse following the withdrawal of Roman power from the edges of its empire. Using climatological evidence, findings from smelting and burial site excavations, and metallurgical analysis, she details the dismantling of the stratified, urban society that began in the late fourth century as the raw materials and skilled workers needed to sustain the metal economy disappeared and the population was forced to rely on widespread scavenging and recycling of metal objects.

	With her probing research and her ability to relate her findings with remarkable clarity, Fleming is changing the way historians view early medieval Britain and providing a framework for incorporating material culture into the writing of history.

	About Roland's Work

	Roland Fryer is an economist illuminating the causes and consequences of economic disparity due to race and inequality in American society. Through innovative empirical and theoretical investigations, Fryer has opened up a range of topics to quantitative analysis, offering new insights on such issues as the cognitive underpinnings of racial discrimination, labor market inequalities, and, in particular, the educational trajectory of minority children. In an examination of the longitudinal trends of testing gaps among elementary schoolchildren, Fryer and a collaborator determined that, after controlling for background characteristics, black and white children enter kindergarten at parity, but their achievement gap widens through higher grade levels; in addition, they found that traditional socioeconomic metrics could not account for this gap. In other work, Fryer posited that social network structure could be a contributing factor. Having constructed an index of social status based on a large, national set of demographic data, his analysis suggests that peer-group loyalty sometimes competes with academic performance, particularly in ethnically heterogeneous environments. Recently, Fryer led a randomized experiment with well over 20,000 students from more than 200 schools in three cities, testing several models of financial incentives to see if they improve children's academic performance. Results collected to date indicate that incentives payments alone have no statistically significant impact on subsequent state test scores. These studies, among many others, demonstrate Fryer's propensity to tackle difficult, often sensitive, social questions with scientific rigor. His research is informing the work of academics and policy makers alike, and he is playing a singular and influential role in ongoing discussions about the effects of racial differences in America.

	About Ruth's Work

	Ruth DeFries is an environmental geographer who uses remotely sensed satellite imagery to explore the relationship between the Earth’s vegetative cover, human modifications of the landscape, and the biochemical processes that regulate the Earth’s habitability. One of the greatest uncertainties researchers face when analyzing the world’s carbon balance is the extent of tropical deforestation. In the past, the deforestation rate has been cobbled together using national statistics on forest cover and coarse-resolution satellite imagery that cannot detect changes finer than the level of individual pixels. Recognizing the limitations of these strategies, DeFries and a team of collaborators developed a more precise approach to mapping land cover that views the landscape as a continuum of land cover characteristics rather than as discrete classes of forests. With this method, DeFries has compiled datasets that have significantly changed the scale and focus of ecosystem research, enhanced her and other researchers’ ability to make more plausible projections of future climate change, and contributed to understanding how human activities are altering habitat needed to conserve biodiversity. At the regional level, she has played a key role in exploring the impact of human-induced changes in land cover, initially focusing on central Africa and moving on to map areas in Southeast Asia and the Brazilian Amazon. Combining expertise with sophisticated satellite-imaging systems and a deep understanding of the environmental effects of agriculture and urbanization, DeFries is providing a clearer picture of the processes transforming our planet.

	Jhabvala lived in India, the setting for her early work, for twenty-four years.  The themes of Indian society and Europeans living in India dominated her stories from 1955 to 1975, a selection of which can be found in Out of India (1986).  After moving to the United States, her writings about America retained Indian undertones.  Her book, Three Continents (1987), was concerned with the three continents where she lived and worked.

	Biography

	After 1962, Jhabvala closely collaborated with filmmakers James Ivory and Ismail Merchant on several films reflecting the same India/U.S. dichotomy: Shakespeare Wallah (1966) and The Autobiography of a Princess (1975) focus on India, while Roseland (1977) is set in the United States.  The creative team also produced American and English classics, including The Bostonians (1984), A Room with a View (1986), and Howards End (1992) and films based on biographical studies of Thomas Jefferson, entitled Jefferson in Paris (1995) and of Pablo Picasso, entitled Surviving Picasso (1996).

	Jhabvala emigrated to England in 1939, to India in 1951, and to the United States in 1975.  She received an M.A. (1951) from Queen Mary College, University of London.

	About Ruth's Work

	Ruth Lubic, a nurse-midwife, has had a significant influence on the delivery of maternity care and child health care in the United States.

	Lubic has promoted midwives as the primary providers of maternity care (with physician back-up) as an effective and less costly alternative to the physician-based care commonly practiced in the United States.  Widely used throughout the industrialized world, this model helps place quality services within reach of underserved, low-income populations.  An advocate for such innovations as freestanding birthing centers, Lubic is respected for her equal dedication to quality of care and family empowerment.  She has also instituted a program for new families in inner-city Washington, D.C.

	Biography

	Lubic is the founder and president emeritus of the D.C. Developing Family Center.  She was general director of the Maternity Center Association for twenty-five years, and, in 1983, she founded its offshoot, the National Association of Childbearing Centers.  In 1995, she was appointed an expert consultant in the Office of Public Health and Science, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  In addition to numerous articles, she is the co-author of Childbearing: A Book of Choices(1987).

	Lubic received an R.N. (1955) from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, and a B.S. (1959), an M.A. (1961), and an Ed.D. (1979) from Columbia University Teachers College.

	About Saidiya's Work

	Saidiya Hartman is a scholar of African American literature and cultural history whose works explore the afterlife of slavery in modern American society and bear witness to lives, traumas, and fleeting moments of beauty that historical archives have omitted or obscured. She weaves findings from her meticulous historical research into narratives that retrieve from oblivion stories of nameless and sparsely documented historical actors, such as female captives on slave ships and the inhabitants of slums at the turn of the twentieth century.

	Her first book, Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America (1997), traces continuities between pre- and post-emancipation eras in the United States by demonstrating how even advocacy-oriented abolitionist rhetoric reproduced the violence and domination of the state of enslavement. She extends her analysis to the present day by challenging contemporary scholars to be wary of recirculating scenes of the violated black body. Her second book, Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (2007), combines elements of historiography and memoir in a meditation on her travels to Ghana in search of a deeper understanding of the experience of enslavement. With this work, Hartman defies the conventions of academic scholarship and employs a speculative method of writing history, which she terms “critical fabulation,” to interrogate the authority of historical archives as the singular source of credible information about the past. She revisits the primal scenes of the African diaspora—its coastal fortresses, dungeons, and hinterlands—and reimagines from multiple perspectives the case of an African girl who was murdered by a ship captain and singled out in a speech by the British abolitionist William Wilberforce in 1792. As a whole, the book dramatizes the challenge of rendering in narrative form such irreparable conditions of loss and dispossession and illuminates the ongoing consequences of these conditions in the present day.

	Hartman’s most recent book, Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments (2019), is similarly inventive in its mode of presentation and immerses readers in the interior lives of young black women who fled the South and moved to Northern cities in the early twentieth century. While drawing from sociological surveys, tenement photographs, reformatory case files, and other sources, she critiques the pathologizing portrayals these official documents present and recovers stories of resistance enacted by famous women (such as Ida B. Wells) and numerous anonymous others who looked outside the bounds of the law to find kinship, intimacy, and freedom. By addressing gaps and omissions in accounts of trans-Atlantic slavery and its aftermath, Hartman has influenced an entire generation of scholars and afforded readers a proximity to the past that would otherwise be foreclosed.

	About Sally's Work

	Sally Temple is a developmental neuroscientist who traces the mechanisms by which embryonic progenitor cells divide into highly specialized neurons and support cells. Though much research in stem cell biology focuses on very early development or engineering replacement organs, Temple focuses her research on the intermediate stages of development to understand the interactions of partially differentiated stem cells to create complex, heterogeneous tissues like the central nervous system. During her training, she was able to isolate and culture a progenitor cell line of glia, which, among many functions, serve as the scaffolding for the neurons they surround. Her research indicates that internal counting mechanisms, rather than external signals in the progenitors, determine the number of cell divisions they undergo. Subsequently, Temple isolated and cultured multipotent cell lines in the embryonic cerebral cortex (a structure with a well-characterized layered structure). She has identified markers on progenitor cell lines and external signaling molecules that participate in maintaining and differentiating them. Recently, Temple has shown that progenitor cells gradually lose their capacity to divide into cell types that normally form the earliest cortical layers; this effect can be delayed partially by reducing expression of a specific gene, Foxg1. Her results suggest that the limited success to date of embryonic stem cell transplants to repair neural damage could be due to introduction of stem cells at the wrong stage of development; it may be that progenitor cells further along in their differentiation will prove more effective. Through her basic research on the differentiation of neural progenitors, Temple brings us closer to developing effective clinical treatments for central nervous system damage due to trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, malignancy, or stroke.

	About Samuel's Work

	Samuel D. Hunter is a playwright who crafts moving portraits of unlikely protagonists and explores the human capacity for empathy through the prism of his characters’ struggles. Born and raised in a small Idaho town, he sets much of his work in his native region, within the nondescript confines of staff break rooms, cramped apartments, and retirement homes inhabited by ordinary people in search of more meaningful human connections. Despite the stark realism of his settings, Hunter leavens his plays with humor and compassion for the lives he depicts, while juxtaposing the banal circumstances of his characters with literary allusions and larger themes of faith and doubt.

	A Bright New Boise (2010) examines the various ways that regret, disappointment, and the longing for some kind of transcendence shape peoples’ actions and concludes with the central character, an evangelical Christian, calling upon the Rapture from a chain store parking lot. In The Whale (2012), one of his most widely produced works to date, Hunter tells the story of Charlie, an expository writing instructor who has been driven by grief to a state of morbid obesity. A writing assignment on Melville’s Moby Dick becomes a leitmotif that resonates throughout the play, as its lonely and adrift characters move toward a deeper understanding of the hopes and motivations that propel one another.

	Hunter premiered three new plays during the 2013–2014 season—The Few (2013), Rest (2014), and A Great Wilderness (2014)—that continue his interest in the poetry of everyday speech and the aspirations of those seldom celebrated on the stage, from a staff of outcasts who run a newspaper for lonely, long-haul truckers to the octogenarian residents of a rest home days away from shutting down. Eschewing irony and judgment of his characters’ decisions, Hunter’s quietly captivating dramas confront the polarizing and socially isolating aspects of contemporary life across the American landscape.

	About Sara's Work

	Sara Seager is an astrophysicist and planetary scientist exploring the possibility of life throughout the galaxy. Adapting the principles of existing planetary science to the study of exoplanets (planets outside the solar system), she is quickly advancing a subfield initially viewed with skepticism by the scientific community. A mere hypothesis until the mid-1990s, nearly 900 exoplanets in more than 600 planetary systems have since been identified, with thousands of more planet candidates known.

	Early in her career, Seager determined that the nature of an exoplanet’s atmosphere could be observed during an eclipse, when the planet’s atmospheric light spectrum is especially distinct from its much brighter host star. She then envisioned and formalized a comprehensive framework for guiding and interpreting observations of planets in this manner, including parameters for calculating planet density and remotely detecting biosignature gases (spectroscopic signatures of chemical compounds that are indicative of life) in their atmospheric spectra. Her early predictions led to the first detection of an exoplanet atmosphere by observations from the Hubble Space Telescope.

	While continuing to create and refine theoretical models of exoplanet atmospheres and interiors, she is also spearheading advanced hardware design and space mission projects, including ExoplanetSat, a university collaboration to build low-cost “nano-satellites” to observe planetary transits. ExoplanetSat is a new concept for space science: a fleet of dozens of cheap copies of an ultra-small space telescope that will open up a new avenue for wide-ranging space exploration. A visionary scientist contributing importantly in every aspect of her field, Seager is finding new celestial frontiers and fueling curiosity about life in worlds beyond our reach.

	About Sarah's Work

	Sarah Deer is a legal scholar and advocate leveraging her deep understanding of tribal and federal law to develop policies and legislation that empower tribal nations to protect Native American women from the pervasive and intractable problem of sexual and domestic violence. Native women living on reservations suffer one of the highest per capita rates of violent crime in the world, but because of limited jurisdictional powers, a lack of resources, and limitations on sentencing authority, tribal courts are often unable to prosecute these crimes, and federal prosecutors decline to take up more than half of the cases that fall under their authority.

	A citizen of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma, Deer has documented in academic scholarship the historical and ideological underpinnings of the failure to adequately protect victims of physical and sexual abuse in Indian Country, and she has worked with grassroots and national organizations attempting to navigate the complex legal and bureaucratic hurdles facing Native victims of violence. This work has allowed her to mediate between sectors within Native communities who disagree on the appropriate role of the U.S. legal system on reservations and on how to most effectively respond to the issue of violence against women. In spearheading a 2007 Amnesty International report, Maze of Injustice, Deer reframed the problem of sexual violence in Indian Country as an international human rights issue. In addition, she brought Native American leaders, health specialists, and women’s advocates together around the intersection between violence against women and tribal governance, thereby launching widespread efforts to reform federal policies that interfere with the ability of tribes to prosecute offenders.

	Deer’s efforts were instrumental in the passage of two landmark pieces of legislation: The Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 increases the sentencing power of tribal courts and requires federal district attorneys to provide detailed information to tribal authorities about cases under their jurisdiction that will not be prosecuted. The 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act restores some of the authority that was stripped from tribal governments by Oliphant v. Suquamish (1978), giving tribal courts the power to prosecute non–Native Americans who assault Native spouses or dating partners or violate a protection order on tribal lands. With her current focus on building tribal infrastructure and reinvigorating the rich history of Native Americans’ pre-colonial criminal justice systems as a source for contemporary laws and policies, Deer is profoundly reshaping the landscape of support and protection for Native American women.

	Sarah Kagan is a nurse scholar with a commitment to clinical excellence, a passion for original scholarship, a dedication to teaching, and a singular ability to meld all three in the interest of older, frail, and vulnerable cancer patients. In an era when health care systems show ever-increasing signs of strain, characterized by nursing shortages, physician overload, and consumer bewilderment, Kagan surfaces as an energetic and creative countervailing force. In Older Adults Coping with Cancer, she challenges ingrained preconceptions about the treatment of older patients, providing a framework for understanding their heterogeneity of responses to cancer. As practicing nurse, Kagan applies these insights to improve medical delivery and outcomes by recognizing that elderly cancer patients respond to treatment differently (sometimes substantially) from younger patients, not only because of physiologic changes but also because of psychosocial factors that shape their experience of the disease. As researcher, Kagan gives shape to and participates in a variety of collaborative research projects of elderly head and neck cancer patients. As master teacher, she inspires new students to think differently about nursing and to venture beyond the comfortable. Still quite young, Kagan is fast becoming an exemplar of a new generation of nurse and is widely sought for her expertise in clinical gerontology at home and abroad.

Sarah Michelson,2019-06-15,55,Female,None Provided,None Provided,"New York, New York",Choreography and Dance,"
                  

	About Sarah's Work

	Sarah Michelson is a choreographer expanding the scope of contemporary dance in works that explore the nature of dance itself, both as an art form and as physical, intellectual, and emotional labor. She unites allusions to techniques, movements, and presentation styles from past sources through a unique aesthetic vision as she interrogates, extends, and subverts modernist and postmodern dance traditions.

	Michelson considers the space and context in which a work is performed—from the floor and seating arrangements to the history of the venue—as essential components of the work’s creation and execution. For Daylight (for Minneapolis) (2005), she used risers to transform the space of a large auditorium into one that conveyed the intimacy of a small performance venue. Her configuration of the venue in which Devotion (2011) took place encouraged an identification between audience and dancer by having the audience occupy the physical space usually reserved for performance. The physicality of dance is paramount to Michelson’s practice. Through the repetition of phrases and sequences that evolve through almost imperceptible shifts, she makes the intense concentration and physical endurance of the dancers visible to the viewer while also confounding the viewers’ sense of time and space. In Devotion Study #1 – The American Dancer (2012), Michelson explores a single movement, drawn from an earlier work in the Devotion series, for nearly ninety minutes. As the dancers circle backward in tightly choreographed loops that form intricate, precise patterns, the audience witnesses the sheer effort, control, and drive of the dancers as their bodies are pushed to extremes, provoking a sense of transcendence in both viewer and performer.

	Michelson continues her exploration of the pleasures, sacrifices, and viability of a life dedicated to dance in a series of recent works, including September 2017/\, created in collaboration with undergraduate dance students over four years, and June 2019/\, performed as a solo by the choreographer herself. Aging is a central theme of these works, as Michelson asks herself and the audience to contemplate what it means to grow older as a dancer. In her critical meditations on the inherent value of dance, Michelson is reaffirming the generative power of the work of art.

	About Sarah's Work

	Sarah Otto is a theoretical biologist whose research focuses on fundamental questions of population genetics and evolution, such as why some species reproduce sexually and why some species carry more than one copy of each gene. Diploidy (having two gene copies) was long thought to represent a mechanism for masking the effects of deleterious gene mutations; a second, ""good"" copy of the gene can still perform the necessary function. But carrying two copies of each gene also makes it easier for deleterious mutations to persist in a population. In a series of studies, Otto and colleagues have analyzed the balance of these evolutionary forces, predicting that multiple gene copies are favored in species with extensive sexual reproduction, where genes are continually placed in new combinations and the ""bad"" copies are masked; by contrast, fewer gene copies are favored in less sexual species, where the benefits of ridding a lineage of its bad mutations matters more. The details and specificity of Otto's models resolve long-standing conceptual questions regarding the evolutionary benefits of sexual reproduction and allow for empirical investigation of a wide variety of related phenomena, such as the ecological structure and conditions that favor sexual over asexual reproduction, the ratio of males and females in a species, the duration of haploid and diploid phases in species' life cycles, and the role of sexual reproduction in host-parasite coevolution. In addition to participating actively in laboratory and field experiments to test and refine her models, Otto is a dedicated educator, having recently co-authored an acclaimed textbook on mathematical modeling that introduces other biologists to the power and rigor of quantitative analysis. Otto's extensive track record of bringing fresh perspectives to thorny conceptual problems suggests that her fundamental contributions to ecology and evolution will continue unabated.

	About Sarah's Work

	Sarah Ruhl is a fresh, compelling, and versatile playwright. In her play, Eurydice (2003), written while a graduate student at Brown University, Ruhl adapts a classic myth to modern times. Written in sparse, contemporary language, the story is told from the perspective of Eurydice and examines the power of love between husband and wife, and father and daughter. Original in tone and setting, Ruhl captures the pain of loss, the lessening of pain over time, and the necessity of forgetting. The Clean House (2004) is, by turns, humorous, delirious, and finally, poignant. In this quirky and surreal work, she skillfully portrays domesticity, love and sisterhood, and the search for humor at death. Another recent work, Passion Play: A Cycle (2005), is a tour de force in which Ruhl charts the politics of religion from the Elizabethan age to the Reagan era and the power across eras of faith, tyranny, and imagination. Additional plays by this prodigious, young dramatist include Melancholy Play (2002), Dead Man’s Cell Phone (2005), and Orlando (2003), an adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel. This young playwright is emerging as a powerful presence in the American theater.

	About Sarah's Work

	Sarah Stillman is a long-form journalist providing new and compelling perspectives on social injustices in stories of people usually invisible to mainstream reporting. Stillman has written on a wide range of topics both in the United States and abroad, including the use and abuse of civil asset forfeiture, the perils faced by young police informants, and the kidnapping of undocumented children at the U.S.-Mexico border.

	Committed to following many-faceted stories through to their conclusion, no matter where and how long it takes her, Stillman teases out the complex forces driving the marginalization of her subjects. One of her first immersive, long-form articles, “The Invisible Army” (2011), exposed the deplorable conditions endured by thousands of foreign logistics workers on American bases in Afghanistan and Iraq: the low-wage laborers who cooked the food, cleaned the latrines, and operated amenities for U.S. troops and private military contractors in both war zones. Her detailed accounts of unpaid wages, sexual assaults, and subpar living conditions sparked a congressional investigation into the practices of government subcontractors.

	In a series of pieces on the criminal justice system, she explores the consequences of both decades-old policies and attempts at reform. “Taken” (2013) traces how civil asset forfeiture, a policy introduced during the war on drugs to target drug cartels’ profits, is routinely abused by local and state authorities as a means to raise operational funds. The article has been cited in court challenges to such seizures, and in 2015 federal cooperation in the practice was prohibited. Stillman added to ongoing debates about the juvenile justice system’s treatment of children as adult offenders in her nuanced portraits of individuals who were placed on sexual offender registries due to sexual misconduct as juveniles (“The List,” 2016). In bringing to light the plight of those at the margins, Stillman is changing the terms of debate around even well-covered issues and demonstrating the continued power and relevance of long-form, immersive journalism.

	About Sarah's Work 

	Sarah Stewart is a planetary scientist shedding light on planet formation and evolution. Through a combination of shock physics experiments on natural materials (such as ice and rock), theoretical models, and computational simulations, Stewart investigates the effects of high-energy impacts onto planets and planet-like bodies. For example, using ice impact experiments, she demonstrated that the presence of subsurface ice significantly and predictably affects the shape of an impact crater, such that the shapes of craters on planets such as Mars can reveal much about their subsurface composition.

	Most notably, Stewart has advanced a novel explanation for how the Moon was formed. It had been widely accepted that the moon was formed from the debris of an object that collided with the proto-Earth. Recent geochemical studies, however, show that the chemical composition of the Moon is very similar to that of the Earth—that is, the Moon is made up primarily of terrestrial materials rather than materials from the impacting celestial body. Stewart and her colleagues have discovered an entirely new astrophysical object, called a synestia, in seeking to resolve this discrepancy. A synestia is a donut-shaped cloud of vaporized and molten rock produced when two objects collide in a high-energy, high-angular momentum impact. The Earth and Moon both formed from one large synestia, produced by such a collision, cooled and condensed. The synestia theory could explain both the similarity in the elemental and chemical compositions of the Earth and Moon as well as heretofore unexplained features in the Moon’s orbit.

	The synestia structure could be a common outcome of collisions during planetary growth and thus hold broader implications for understanding the evolution of other planets. With the ever-growing number of exoplanet discoveries and missions to other planets, Stewart will play a critical role in providing a firmer and more comprehensive basis for understanding planet formation and the resulting physical, geological, and geochemical features of planets.

	About Sarkis' Work

	Sarkis Mazmanian is a microbiologist investigating the mechanisms underlying the symbiotic relationship between hosts and their beneficial microbial partners. Non-pathogenic bacteria colonize virtually every tissue type with exposure to the external environment; the enteric bacteria found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which contains by far the largest number and species of bacteria, have long been known to provide benefits such as delivering certain nutrients and protection against pathogenic bacteria. In a series of studies, Mazmanian and colleagues have teased out the complex interplay between gut bacterial species and the host immune system. His results show, for example, that the probiotic species B. fragilis expresses a molecule known as polysaccharide A, which suppresses a specific immune pathway in the host that would otherwise generate an inflammatory response to a different bacterium, H. hepaticus. Absent this suppression, H. hepaticus triggers pathologic changes in the GI tract similar to ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. More recently, Mazmanian found that enteric bacteria can influence the progression of immune activity in distant tissues such as the nervous system. In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (a human autoimmune disease), he demonstrated that germ-free animals, which are otherwise resistant to induced autoimmune brain inflammation, become susceptible after their GI tract is exposed to segmented filamentous bacteria, suggesting a specific role that intestinal bacterial fauna could play in the development of autoimmune disorders in tissues distant from the intestines (e.g., the central nervous system). On the basis of his results and others’, Mazmanian has posited that harmless bacteria induce host immune tolerance by manipulating pathways that distinguish self from pathogen, a distinction that goes awry in autoimmune diseases. By elucidating the critical role of these microbes in human health, Mazmanian is laying the foundation for a new understanding of human-microbiome symbiosis that could lead to new therapies or preventive treatments for a broad class of human diseases.

	Sebastian Ruth is a violist, violinist, and music educator who has turned a string quartet and a storefront space into a thriving and enriching force in the lives of urban youth and their families in Providence, Rhode Island. After graduating from Brown University in 1997, he founded Community MusicWorks, a nonprofit organization based in Providence’s West End that offers frequent performances and free musical instruction led by its house ensemble, the Providence String Quartet. In contrast to many arts outreach programs, Ruth and his fellow quartet members have taken up residence within the inner-city community they serve, in keeping with their vision of music as a nurturing neighborhood necessity similar to a library, a church, or a health clinic. Equally focused on expanding their repertoire and their development as practicing artists, quartet members perform throughout the region and open their rehearsals to the community. Ruth’s group provides all students—from elementary to high school—with an instrument on long-term loan, close mentoring relationships with instructors, and exposure to an expansive variety of music through workshops and field trips. In addition to these core activities, Ruth has broadened his original scope to include artists-in-residence from other musical disciplines, commissioning new works with themes that resonate powerfully with diverse, urban residents, and fellowships for conservatory-trained instrumentalists interested in embarking on nontraditional musical careers. As organizations inspired by Community MusicWorks take root in New Haven and Boston, Ruth is creating rewarding musical experiences for often-forgotten populations and forging a new, multifaceted role beyond the concert hall for the twenty-first-century musician.

	Shahzia Sikander is an artist whose visually striking, resonant works merge the traditional South Asian art of miniature painting with contemporary forms and styles. Her art ranges from intimate watercolors to mural-scale wall paintings and multi-layered paper installations, from intricate photographs to bold juxtapositions of painting and digital animation. Trained as a miniaturist at the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan, Sikander recasts the conventions of this centuries-old tradition and challenges notions about the division of art and craft. While traversing cultural, geographic, and psychological boundaries and combining seemingly disparate formal elements, she skillfully expresses a respect for the distinctiveness of the cultures she explores. The results are painstakingly detailed drawings and vibrantly hued paintings that reveal themselves over time and reflect profoundly on the relationship between the present and the past and the richness of multicultural identities. In other projects, Sikander experiments with digital media to uproot the unity of her own miniatures and reposition their fragments with graceful movements of camera-work. This artist’s constant rethinking of media and visual sources makes her work a fluid, elaborately rendered commentary on diasporic experiences and our ever-changing world.

	About Shannon's Work

	Shannon Lee Dawdy is an archaeologist and anthropologist who links scholarship with historical preservation to illuminate the history of the Atlantic World since 1450. In addition to work on the Southeast United States and Caribbean, Dawdy has produced insightful studies of New Orleans from its establishment as a French colony to the present day. In Building the Devil’s Empire: French Colonial New Orleans (2008), she integrates the intellectual life of the community with the story of the adventurers, entrepreneurs, and smugglers who resisted governance, providing a markedly expanded narrative of the colonial dynamics and structure of the region. Her recent fieldwork in New Orleans, concentrating on the former site of the Rising Sun Hotel and St. Antoine’s Garden behind St. Louis Cathedral, is the largest archaeological excavation undertaken to date in the French Quarter. These two sites are an important part of her current project: an exploration of the connections between aesthetics and social life. Complementing her academic work, Dawdy has also been a vocal advocate for historical preservation. She served as special liaison between the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Louisiana State Historic Preservation Office to ensure that recovery efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina remained cognizant of the city’s singular archaeological heritage. Through her boundary-crossing scholarship, fieldwork, and efforts to engage the public in uncovering the history of their communities, Dawdy is enriching the arenas of historical archaeology and urban preservation.

	Sharon Emerson is a biologist with broad interests in evolution and ecology.

	Her work has centered on an exploration of the origin of morphological novelties and understanding the biodiversity of form from various points of view.  Routinely crossing disciplinary boundaries between systematics, functional morphology, molecular genetics, behavioral and physiological ecology and conservation biology, Emerson examines organisms as potentially integrated morphological units, having demonstrated that selective significance is most interestingly considered in the context of other features.  Studying frog morphology through a series of research questions focused on various tropical frogs in Borneo, she has shown that evolution has occurred in systematic ways that are only partly related to ecological function.  Her model of analysis for determining the effects of different aerodynamic conditions on a specific type of frog’s flying abilities helped to define the emerging field of ecomorphology.

	Shawn Carlson is a physicist and an educator who works to make the scientific process less mystifying and more comprehensible to nonscientists.

	Through his dissemination of inexpensive experiments, many designed by Carlson himself, he demonstrates that scientific research is a quest to understand natural phenomena in which everyone can participate. He gained early attention with a controlled scientific study of astrological predictions. The resulting manuscript, published in Nature, found that astrological charts do not outperform random guesses in predicting personality characteristics. In 1994, Carlson founded the Society for Amateur Scientists, which identifies opportunities for curious amateurs to investigate important, but as yet unsolved, scientific questions and to provide a forum for the organization of amateur research projects. As author of the “Amateur Scientist” column for the Scientific American, Carlson features innovative and inexpensive designs for equipment and experiments that amateurs can use to explore current research questions.

	About Sheila's Work

	Sheila Nirenberg is a neuroscientist exploring fundamental questions about how the brain encodes visual information and developing an alternative approach to restoring sight after photoreceptor cell degeneration. In the visual sensory system in mammals, the photoreceptor cells in the retina take in information from the outside world, such as an image or visual pattern. This information is then passed through the retinal circuitry to the ganglion cells, which transform it into a neural code that the brain can understand. In the case of diseases such as macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, which affect approximately 20–25 million people worldwide, vision is lost when deteriorating photoreceptor cells no longer take in visual signals.

	Instead of trying to replace the lost photoreceptor cells—an approach that is usually quite invasive and that has shown limited benefit for advanced stage disease—Nirenberg has developed a method for bypassing the damaged photoreceptor cells entirely and interacting directly with the ganglion cells. She crystallized the complex relationship between visual stimuli and corresponding ganglion cell activity and deciphered the specific neural “codes” that are generated in response to dynamic spatial and temporal visual patterns. Nirenberg invented a computerized eyeglass prosthetic that transmits the codes to the ganglion cells, which then send the codes to the brain. Although still in the early phases of clinical testing, this new, less invasive strategy has obtained very promising results in mice.

	In another line of research, Nirenberg is adapting and applying her discoveries in neural coding to machine vision algorithms with the goal of advancing the state of the art in robotic “vision” and brain-machine interfaces. In addressing fundamental questions about sensory signal processing in both mammals and machines, Nirenberg is poised to catalyze a major leap in the science of visual perception.

	About Shen's Work

	Shen Wei, founder and artistic director of Shen Wei Dance Arts, is a choreographer who combines Eastern and Western influences and multiple artistic disciplines to create a bold and visually arresting form of dance-theater. Born in China’s Hunan province and trained from his youth in calligraphy, painting, and Chinese operatic performance, Shen became a founding member of the Guangdong Modern Dance Company, the first modern dance company in China, prior to moving to New York in 1995. Through choreographed movements that are precise and inventive, he and his dancers perform highly stylized steps and gestures inspired by Western dance traditions as well as Chinese opera, acrobatics, and martial arts. With the compositional rigor of a visual artist, he incorporates vivid colors, striking costume design, and imaginative use of space into theatrical works that are, at once, kinetic paintings. Staging his dances on a grand scale with a high level of production detail, Shen defies expectations with each new work. Folding (2000) begins with dancers draped in dramatic red against a shimmering blue backdrop and concludes with the chanting of Tibetan Buddhist monks, while his Rite of Spring (2003) offers a spare, minimalist approach to a classic modernist score. In these and other works, Shen Wei fuses a diverse range of art forms into an aesthetically striking dance language that is all his own.

	Shen Wei received degrees from the Hunan Arts Academy and the Guangdong Dance School. He performed with the Hunan State Xian Opera Company (1984-1989) and the Guangdong Modern Dance Company (1991-1994) prior to founding Shen Wei Dance Arts in 2000. His company has performed in festivals and at venues throughout the U.S. and internationally, including the Lincoln Center Festival, the American Dance Festival, Jacob’s Pillow, Sadler’s Wells, and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, among many others.

	Shwetak Patel is a computer scientist who has invented a series of sensor technology systems for home environments with the goal of saving energy and improving daily life through a broad range of applications. Much of his work to date has focused on the development of low-cost and easy-to-deploy devices that can detect and measure household energy consumption without an elaborate network of expensive instruments. To allow residents to track their energy usage down to the level of individual appliances and fixtures, Patel's distinctive approach leverages existing infrastructure — such as gas lines, electrical wiring, plumbing, and ventilation ducts — and requires only a minimal number of small, wirelessly connected sensors attached to the central hookup of each of these utility sources. When coupled with a machine learning algorithm that analyzes patterns of activity and the signature noise produced by each appliance, the sensors enable users to measure and disaggregate their energy and water consumption and to detect inefficiencies more effectively. In addition to the resource conservation applications of his sensor systems, Patel is also exploring their potential for home security or elder care, as they serve the related function of sensing human activity and monitoring movement throughout a building's rooms. While envisioning cutting-edge new tools to address pressing social challenges and to make the buildings we live in more responsive to our needs, Patel devises elegant, simple solutions that dramatically reduce the cost of implementation.

	About Stacy's Work

	Stacy Jupiter is a marine scientist integrating local cultural practices with field research to develop conservation solutions that protect both the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and the well-being of communities dependent on them. Working in concert with local communities, Jupiter is establishing and applying new approaches to natural resource management based on traditional ecological knowledge and practices that take into account the livelihoods and food security of inhabitants.

	Jupiter works primarily in Melanesia, a Pacific region that includes Fiji, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea and that is of particular importance to conservation efforts due to its extraordinary biodiversity. The primary method used by Melanesian communities to manage coral reef natural resources is periodic closures to fishing (known as tabu). Jupiter joined villagers in experimental harvests and provided clear scientific evidence of the efficacy of their approach, as well as the means for communities to make more informed decisions about when, where, and how long to close off areas of the reef. Her research has the potential for improving the sustainability of thousands of tabu areas across the southwestern Pacific, and Jupiter is spearheading efforts to link these locally managed marine areas to larger-scale marine spatial planning processes, thereby enabling multiple, overlapping conservation efforts. Her research on linkages between land and sea use is uncovering the multiple impacts of extractive industries in the region. With collaborators she has shown how increases in logging and mining not only have downstream implications for water quality on coral reefs but also play a critical role in transmission patterns of waterborne diseases such as typhoid.

	Recognizing that broad-based local support of conservation efforts is critical to their success, Jupiter creates tailored materials to communicate with a range of stakeholders, from comic books and puppet shows to teach children about marine conservation to scientific reports that inform national policy on coastal fisheries and guides on best practices for holistic resource management in the Pacific Islands. Jupiter has successfully demonstrated that effective ecosystem management and conservation is enhanced by integrating science with the social drivers of resource use and community well-being, and she is poised to play a critical role in ensuring that global conservation efforts result in equitable outcomes for all communities.

	Biography

	Quote from Stacy

	My work focuses on understanding the impacts of environmental change and using the outcomes to reconnect people to nature...

	Through technology and ingenuity, people have transformed the very systems on Earth that keep us alive and enable our climate, water and food, while at the same time becoming more detached from the environment. This is leading to tipping points where degraded land and seascapes can no longer support people and the species they depend on. My work focuses on understanding the impacts of environmental change and using the outcomes to reconnect people to nature so that they will make smarter decisions that both protect the planet and improve human well-being. The Pacific islands offer tremendous opportunities for teaching lessons to the world about environmental sustainability through reinvigorating customary knowledge and practice and building on people’s strong cultural attachment to place.

	About Stanley's Work

	Stanley Cavell is a scholar who applies the traditions of analytic philosophy to a broad range of subjects.

	Cavell’s interests include film criticism, literary and psychoanalytic theory, American studies, and morality.  He has examined how dramatic literature, especially that of Shakespeare, bears on the problems of human knowledge and how central traditions in Western philosophy are interrelated.  At the core of his thought is the view that skepticism is not a theoretical position to be refuted by theory, but a reflection of the fundamental limits of human knowledge of the self, others, and the external world that must be accepted.

	Cavell’s books include The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film (1971), Must We Mean What We Say? A Book of Essays (1976), Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage (1981), Disowning Knowledge: In Six Plays of Shakespeare (1987), A Pitch of Philosophy: Autobiographical Exercises (1994), Emerson's Transcendental Etudes (2003), and Cities of Words: Pedagogical Letters on a Register of the Moral Life (2004).  He is the Walter M.

	About Stefan's Work

	Stefan Savage is a computer scientist using an interdisciplinary approach to address challenges to computer security and to counter cybercrime. In addition to identifying technological deficiencies, he contextualizes cybersecurity threats within much broader ecosystems, including underlying economic incentives and social structures contributing to vulnerabilities.

	In early work, Savage created new strategies for defending against malware and what are known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS). To impede the spread of fast-acting worms, which can quickly compromise an entire network, he and colleagues devised a method for automatically measuring unusual data patterns and identifying worm signatures (or recurring strings of code) across a network. The growing prevalence of physical ""smart"" devices in our lives has made network cybersecurity an increasingly urgent priority. Savage and colleagues were the first to demonstrate the ability to hack an automobile remotely—including taking control over the engine and brakes and monitoring conversations taking place within the car. In addition to working with car manufacturers to mitigate the immediate security threats, Savage has also investigated how the idiosyncrasies of the automobile sector's supply chains give rise to, and hinder correction of, compromised car software. More recently, Savage and collaborators measured network-level interactions to characterize the value chain of internet-related crime. They identified a critical bottleneck for spam email campaigns and online counterfeit goods transactions: only a few banks accept the credit card transactions necessary for these online ventures to monetize their activities. These findings allowed the drug and credit card companies to disrupt the business models of several counterfeit drug rings to such an extent that they collapsed.

	With deep insights into internet security and a commitment to tackling problems of immediate, real-world importance, Savage is playing a key role in shaping cybersecurity debates among computer scientists while also informing efforts to fight ongoing security threats posed by a variety of actors.

	Stefan Savage received a B.S. from Carnegie Mellon University (1991) and a Ph.D. (2002) from the University of Washington. In 2000, he joined the faculty of the University of California at San Diego, where he is currently a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, co-director of the Center for Evidence-Based Security Research, and co-director of the Center for Networked Systems. His articles have been published in numerous conference proceedings, including those of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, and IEEE Security and Privacy, among others.

	About Stephen's Work

	Stephen Houston is an anthropologist, archaeologist, and epigrapher whose insightful interpretations of Mayan iconography and hieroglyphic inscriptions shed new light on the intellectual culture of Mesoamerican society and address fundamental questions about the role of writing in ancient civilizations. He has worked on the excavations of several major Mayan cities, most recently the ancient city of Piedras Negras in Guatemala, which had not been explored since its initial discovery more than sixty years ago. This dig unearthed several monuments and structures, and Houston’s nuanced analysis of their functions and social meaning is prompting a significant revision of the history of the city’s development. As an epigrapher, Houston draws on inscriptions and figural art to reconstruct the political and social structure of Mayan civilization, including the dynamics of royal court life and the role of religion. His interpretations of stylized representations of the human body demonstrate how displays of emotion were depicted and used by Mayan elites to reinforce their status within a hierarchical society. By considering Mayan script in the context of both ancient and modern civilizations, he has proposed new arguments, as well, about how writing systems function and how they originate, evolve, and expire. Houston’s interdisciplinary approach brings into sharper focus the poetics and preoccupations of ancient Mayan texts and illuminates the relationship between histories recorded in hieroglyphic texts and those pieced together through archaeological evidence.

	About Steve's Work

	Steve Coleman is an alto saxophonist and composer whose technical virtuosity and engagement with musical traditions and styles from around the world are expanding the expressive and formal possibilities of spontaneous composition.

	Whether performing solo or with his regular ensemble, Steve Coleman and Five Elements, Coleman delivers signature performances of notated works and brings a masterful facility to intricate and complex improvised pieces. His original compositions weave disciplined rhythmic structures, refined tonal progressions, and overlapping and mixed meters into soulful and fluid interpretations. In his improvisational performances, Coleman energizes and updates iconic musical idioms in the creative traditions of luminaries like John Coltrane and Charlie Parker by infusing them with melodic, rhythmic, and structural components inspired by music of the larger African Diaspora, as well as from the continents of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas (in particular, West Africa, Cuba, Brazil, Europe, India, and Indonesia). His work also draws heavily on inspiration from nature, metaphysics, and science, integrating, for example, patterns derived from the cycles and relationships of the planets in our solar system or, as on Functional Arrhythmias (2013), the pulsating patterns of the human heart.

	Coleman’s commitment to mentorship and community has also distinguished his career. M-Base (Macro-Basic Array of Structured Extemporizations), a cooperative that Coleman co-founded in the mid-1980s and that is still vital today as the non-profit organization M-Base Concepts, Inc., provides a supportive environment for musical experimentation and original performance, and his workshops, seminars, online instruction, and interdisciplinary collaborations encourage younger musicians both here and abroad to push the boundaries of their craft. Influential well beyond the scope of saxophone performance and composition, Coleman is redefining the vocabulary and vernaculars of contemporary music.

	About Steven's Work

	Steven Goodman is a conservation biologist who studies and documents the endangered, diverse, and previously unknown plants and animals of Madagascar. In terms of biodiversity and conservation, no single country in the world is more dynamic, more diverse, and more understudied than Madagascar. A researcher at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History, Goodman spends most of his time in Madagascar where he works with international conservation groups and local biologists to record and preserve ecosystems increasingly threatened by rapid deforestation and population growth. He also founded and leads the Ecological Training Program (ETP) that mentors, trains, and prepares local Malagasy biologists in pressing conservation issues, a model that is being replicated elsewhere in ecologically threatened regions in Africa and around the world. A tenacious researcher, Goodman has braved extreme conditions to identify dozens of new bird, insect, and mammal species, to conduct rigorous biological surveys and inventories, and to transform the scientific knowledge of the region. He is the co-editor and lead author of The Natural History of Madagascar, the definitive book on the island’s geology, soils, climate, forest and human ecology, plants, invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. With inexhaustible energy, Goodman has brought Madagascar to the forefront of international conservation, demonstrating the urgent need for preservation and the power of mentoring future custodians of the world’s biological richness.

	About Stuart's Work

	The author of three short story collections, numerous anthologized works of short fiction, and two books of poetry, Stuart Dybek roots his writing firmly in Chicago’s ethnic neighborhoods, then mines these locales for the dreams, folklore, and fantasies that flourish within. Throughout his work, Dybek establishes an almost palpable sense of place, meticulously depicting each physical detail, from the flickering glow of a portable TV to the camphor reek of a grandmother’s sickbed. It is with the same precision, humor, and compassion that he renders his characters and their sometimes triumphant but often disappointing circumstances. His stories resemble parables, as he pays tribute to the religious and folkloric heritage preserved by the elders who populate his fiction and to writers such as Franz Kafka, Isaac Babel, and Bruno Schulz. The simplicity of Dybek’s parable-like style is complemented by complex imagery and forays into the vibrant dream-lives and mystical visions of his characters, those who dwell between the real and the fantastic so as to expand their stifling urban surroundings. Dybek’s work dramatizes how a new storytelling tradition takes shape; his writing borrows from the literature and iconography of the Old World yet emerges from the New World – from the speech and streets and music and movies that feed the imaginations of contemporary American communities.

	About Subhash's Work

	Subhash Khot is a theoretical computer scientist whose work is providing critical insight into unresolved problems in the field of computational complexity. Since the 1970s, one of the major questions in theory of computing has been whether or not P = NP. That is, can every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer also be quickly solved by a computer? Most computer scientists believe that P does not equal NP—that there are problems, known as NP-hard problems, for which a solution cannot be found efficiently by an algorithm. Thousands of practical problems, from the best way to design a computer chip to optimal airplane schedules, have been shown to be NP-hard.

	Over the past two decades, most research in this area has focused on whether, and how well, solutions to these problems can be approximated. To this discussion, Khot contributed the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), which proposes that for one specific problem about assigning colors to the nodes of a network according to a set of constraints, finding even an approximate solution is NP-hard. While seemingly a simple statement with limited applicability, the UGC has spurred novel and unexpected research. Work by Khot and others has demonstrated that although it is as yet unproven, the conjecture sheds new light on the computational complexity of many, very diverse, optimization tasks. If true, then solutions to a host of problems, many of them seemingly unrelated to the original problem of the UGC, are also too hard to approximate. Even if the UGC ultimately is found to be false, efforts to prove it have led to new theorems in geometry, Fourier analysis, the mathematics of foams, and even the stability of different election systems.

	As computers come to drive ever more aspects of our lives, greater understanding of the limitations of computing is increasingly important. Khot’s continued ingenuity and tenacity in exploring the potential of the UGC will drive this important and fruitful area of research for many years to come.

	About Sue's Work

	Sue Goldie is a physician and public health researcher whose leadership, rigorous analyses, and creative interventions are transforming women’s healthcare around the world. Incorporating mathematical modeling, the science of medical decision-making, and risk analysis, she has successfully identified important new strategies to improve women’s health in underserved populations. Together with her collaborators, Goldie has developed complex and comprehensive epidemiological models for diseases such as HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, and hepatitis C.  By weighing disease characteristics and quantitatively assessing possible health interventions for potential populations, Goldie has translated her models into actionable information to guide global health interventions and policies. A focus of Goldie’s research is the human papilloma virus (HPV) and its link to cervical cancer, the most common cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Combining clinical, scientific and mathematical methodology, Goldie has demonstrated that non-physicians can be trained to conduct direct visual inspections or HPV testing to detect early cervical cancer, a more practical and cost-effective approach than the expensive and technically challenging Pap smear screening method. She has taken her findings to the field, creating practical, sustainable cervical cancer-screening programs in Haiti, India, Kenya, Peru, South Africa, and Thailand. Indeed, by bridging the gap between clinical researchers and global policy-makers, Goldie has already enhanced the lives of tens of thousands of women and has the potential to do so on a broader scale still.

	About sujatha's Work

	sujatha baliga is an attorney and restorative justice practitioner demonstrating the efficacy of survivor-centered restorative justice alternatives to traditional legal interventions as a means of helping crime survivors to heal, holding those who have caused harm accountable, and breaking cycles of recidivism and violence.

	Restorative justice practices encourage constructive, rather than punitive or retributive, responses to wrongdoing. Those who have caused harm, crime survivors, and affected communities come together to participate in a facilitated dialogue and formulate a consensus-based plan for making amends. As director of the Restorative Justice Project, an initiative of the national innovation and research center Impact Justice, baliga is increasing the availability of restorative justice alternatives for young people in cities across the United States. The project builds upon the success of a pre-charge, restorative justice diversion program baliga launched in Alameda County, California, which, in contrast to other restorative justice programs that focus exclusively on lower-level harms, works with youth who have been arrested for felonies and other serious harms. baliga’s team provides training and technical assistance to similar programs in multiple counties and states that operate in collaboration with community-based organizations and partners from the criminal and juvenile legal systems. They also collect and evaluate data on rates of recidivism reduction and crime survivor satisfaction from each site to inform the implementation of restorative justice models more broadly and to deepen understanding of their effectiveness among a diverse range of participants and agencies, including community-based organizations, courts, police departments, and district attorneys’ offices. baliga’s efforts to reduce the juvenile legal system’s reliance on incarceration hold promise for diminishing its highly disproportionate and detrimental effects on communities of color.

	In a closely related area of practice, baliga develops and facilitates restorative justice responses to address the complex and specific needs of survivors of intimate partner and sexual violence. She brings to this work not only her skills as an attorney and prior professional experience as both a victim advocate and public defender, but also her own lived experience. As a survivor of child sexual abuse, she powerfully articulates how punitive systems of criminal justice often fail to offer sufficient familial support and pathways to healing for survivors and frequently have silencing and shaming effects that prolong their suffering. With vision, compassion, and a rigorous, evidence-based approach to implementation, baliga is expanding access to and increasing the visibility of restorative justice practices while honoring their centuries-old, indigenous roots.

	Biography

	sujatha baliga received an AB (1993) from Harvard University and a JD (1999) from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Since 2015, she has served as director of the Restorative Justice Project at Impact Justice, where she is also a Just Beginnings Collaborative Fellow. She is a co-founder of Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice, was a Soros Justice Fellow at Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth (2008), and has worked previously as a public defender and victim advocate in New Mexico and New York.

	Quote from sujatha

	Restorative justice inspires me because I get to see families and communities achieve safety, accountability, and healing through dialogue.

	As a child sexual abuse survivor growing up in an immigrant family, I was more afraid of ‘help’ than I was of my father. I didn’t want to be placed in foster care or for my father to be locked up, and I worried that telling the truth might trigger immigration consequences for my family. As an adult, I became a victim advocate, and then a public defender, but I was never satisfied with legal outcomes that framed success as beating the other ‘side.’ Ultimately, I was drawn to restorative justice because it works best without involving the criminal legal system or other systems of separation and oppression. Restorative justice inspires me because I get to see families and communities achieve safety, accountability, and healing through dialogue. It helps me create what I needed when I was a child.

	About Sunil's Work


	Sunil Amrith is a historian exploring migration in South and Southeast Asia and its role in shaping present-day social and cultural dynamics. His focus on migration, rather than political forces such as colonial empires and the formation of modern nations, demonstrates that South Asia (primarily India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka) and Southeast Asia (including Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore) are tied by centuries of movement of people and goods around and across the Bay of Bengal.

	In Migration and Diaspora in Modern Asia (2011) and Crossing the Bay of Bengal (2013), Amrith combines the theoretical frameworks of oceanic and environmental history with archival, ethnographic, and visual research to chart how migration transformed individuals, families, and communities. Using narratives and records left by coastal traders, merchants, and migrants, he evokes the lives of ordinary Indians who made homes in new lands across the bay. Amrith's examination of the emergence of diverse, multiethnic coastal communities sheds new light on the social and political consequences of colonization. Colonialism diminished some of the intimate cultural, social, and economic connections among the peoples of coastal areas while enabling new ones. Many bonds finally snapped during decolonization, however, when defining national boundaries and national identity became the priority.

	Amrith's analysis of the forces driving migration in Crossing the Bay of Bengal takes into account the ways in which climatic patterns around the bay defined the lives of migrants and coastal residents. He will expand on this work in his current project on the history of environmental change in Asia, focusing particularly on the monsoon in the context of a changing climate. Amrith is leading a reorientation of South and Southeast Asian history and opening new avenues for understanding the region's place in global history.

	About Susan's Work

	Susan Mango is a biologist who synthesizes approaches from genetics, genomics, ecology, and embryology to address one of the most challenging questions in developmental biology — how complex organs form. Though much effort has been devoted to understanding how cells differentiate from a pluripotent state into specialized tissues (e.g., nerve, muscle, blood vessels), little is known about how these tissues interact and integrate into cohesive, functioning organs. Using the nematode digestive system as a model, Mango has identified a single gene, pha-4, as being crucial to coordinated development of this creature’s pharynx. Mutations in this gene affect many different cell types in different regions, but each has a critical role in the developing pharynx. Using a combination of microarray techniques and computational algorithms, Mango has teased out the mechanism of action of the PHA-4 protein as a promoter for a host of other genes involved in pharynx development. Her results solidify the hypothesis that organ formation in the worm has a distinctly genetic basis. Through her multifaceted exploration of the integrative biology of nematode development, Mango provides critical insights into the complex process of organogenesis.

	About Susan's Work 

	Susan Murphy is a statistician developing new methodologies to evaluate courses of treatment for individuals coping with chronic or relapsing disorders such as depression or substance abuse. In contrast to the treatment of acute illness, where clinicians make a single decision about treatment, doctors treating chronic ailments make a sequence of decisions over time about the best therapeutic approach based on the current state of a patient, the stage of the disease, and the individual’s response to prior treatments.

	Murphy has developed a formal model of this decision-making process and an innovative design for clinical trials that allow researchers to test the efficacy of adaptive interventions. While the standard clinical trial paradigm simply tests and compares “one shot” treatments in a defined population, Murphy’s Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) is a means for learning how best to dynamically adapt treatment to each individual’s response over time. Using SMART, clinicians assess and modify patients’ treatments during the trial, an approach with potential applications in the treatment of a range of chronic diseases—such as ADHD, alcoholism, drug addiction, HIV/AIDS, and cardiovascular disease—that involve therapies that are regularly reconsidered and replaced as the disease progresses.

	As Murphy continues to refine adaptive interventions, she is working to increase opportunities for implementation in clinical settings through collaborations with medical researchers, clinicians, and computer scientists focused on sequential decision making. By translating statistical theory into powerful tools for evaluating and tailoring complex medical therapies, Murphy is poised to have a significant impact on the field of personalized medicine, an area of great activity in biomedical research today.

	Suzan-Lori Parks is a playwright whose risk-taking, dramatic presentations reflect and refract social imagery from American culture and history. By creating compelling stories and characters that dramatize the complex influences that form both individual and collective identity, her explorations challenge us to reconsider our perceptions of others and ourselves. In Venus (1997), Parks ignores the common conventions of stage realism to call attention to the ambivalent depiction of racism, sexism, and economic oppression seen in postbellum U.S. theatrical productions. By contrast, In the Blood (1999) presents us with a meditation on social responsibility and the treatment of the most indigent. These and other works are characterized by her signature use of provocative stagecraft, gritty colloquialisms, and wordplay inspired by the looped and spiraling forms of jazz.

	About Ta-Nehisi's Work

	Ta-Nehisi Coates is a journalist, blogger, and memoirist who brings personal reflection and historical scholarship to bear on America’s most contested issues. Writing without shallow polemic and in a measured style, Coates addresses complex and challenging issues such as racial identity, systemic racial bias, and urban policing. He subtly embeds the present—in the form of anecdotes about himself or others—into historical analysis in order to illustrate how the implications of the past are still experienced by people today.

	In a series of blog posts about the Civil War and a long-form print essay on “The Case for Reparations” (2014), Coates grapples with the rationalizations for slavery and their persistence in twentieth-century policies like Jim Crow and redlining—the practice of denying loans and other financial services to African Americans. In “Reparations” Coates compellingly argues for remuneration for the economic impact on African Americans denied the ability to accumulate wealth or social status for generations. At once deeply felt and intensely researched, the essay prompted a national conversation.

	Coates opens a window to the formation of his worldview in his memoir, The Beautiful Struggle (2008), a reflection on race, class, and masculinity told through the lens of growing up in Baltimore as the son of a former Black Panther. Coates describes the evolution of his views on constructions of race in Between the World and Me (2015). In this passionate and lyrical book-length essay addressed to his teenage son, he unflinchingly articulates the physical and mental experience of being a black man in America today. A highly distinctive voice, Coates is emerging as a leading interpreter of American concerns to a new generation of media-savvy audiences and having a profound impact on the discussion of race and racism in this country.

	About Tami's Work

	Tami Bond is an environmental engineer working at the interface of engineering and public policy to unravel the global effects of black carbon emissions on climate and human health and to comprehensively understand how energy interfaces with the atmosphere. Black carbon, or soot, is created essentially any time something is burned—from diesel engines and agricultural burning to home heating and cooking—and varies considerably by source; yet traditionally, large-scale global climate models have worked with rough estimations and little fidelity at the source level. The challenges to including black carbon as a factor in climate models are significant: the ubiquitous and diverse array of sources, complex atmospheric processes, and a lack of standardized global inventories made accurate assessments extremely difficult, and representation of the impact of black carbon was crude.

	Bond’s goal is an integrated global framework, including standardization of how observations of black carbon emissions are made and interpreted, how inventories and impacts are quantified and classified, and incorporation of this information into global climate models. She has undertaken both laboratory-based studies and fieldwork to develop measurements of black carbon’s physical characteristics and optical properties—that is, how much light is absorbed. Bond and her laboratory have characterized specific sources of black carbon at the local level in an array of remote locations, including cookstoves and kerosene lanterns, allowing for not only collection and analysis but also improved quantitative estimates of historical data.

	By compiling these new analyses with those of other atmospheric scientists globally, Bond has provided the most comprehensive synthesis of the impact of black carbon on climate to date, indicating that global black carbon emissions are one of the most important contributions to anthropogenic (or man-made) climate change. She has gone beyond the laboratory to translate her research into a scale and form suitable for policy application, and she continues toward a broader vision of how energy, with emissions as a focal point, interfaces with the atmosphere. With implications ranging from local action to international policy assessments of climate impact, Bond’s work has the potential to unlock the role of energy in our climate system and to help millions breathe cleaner air.

	About Tara's Work

	Tara Donovan is an inventive young sculptor whose installations bring wonder to the most common objects of everyday life. Donovan’s site-specific, sculptural works transform ordinary accumulated materials into intriguing visual and physical installations. Choosing a single object – such as a transparent drinking straw, scotch tape, a Styrofoam cup, or a paper clip – Donovan experiments with assembling it in different ways. Sensitive to the specific needs of her materials and the nature of her exhibit spaces, her installations are often arranged in ways reminiscent of geological or biological forms. For her 2003 installation entitled “Haze,” Donovan stacked over two million clear plastic drinking straws against a 42-foot-long gallery wall. The resulting effect, with its shifts in color, form, light, and surface, was that of a fog bank or a diaphanous cloud, providing the viewer with a compelling, perceptually transformative experience. In a 2007 untitled work, Donovan created a 50x60-foot installation using over three million seven-ounce plastic drinking cups in rows of different heights, resembling a serene, iridescent ice field. This singular artist is creating a dazzling body of work that will enrich the fields of contemporary sculpture and installation art for years to come.

	About Tara's Work

	Tara Zahra is a historian who is challenging the way we view the development of the concepts of nation, family, and ethnicity and painting a more integrative picture of twentieth-century European history. With conceptual and empirical rigor, Zahra’s writings combine broad sociohistorical analysis with extensive archival work across a wide range of locales.

	Her first book, Kidnapped Souls: National Indifference and the Battle for Children in the Bohemian Lands, 1900­–1948 (2008), examines the twentieth-century cultural politics of German and Czech nationalism with children as the centerpiece, demonstrating that the changing concept of who owns children was essential to the definition of national identities. Zahra refocuses our understanding of nationalism and nation-building by exploring the conflicts over raising and educating children in the Bohemian lands in the first half of the twentieth century—from the multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire, through the Czechoslovak Republic, the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia, and the postwar Czechoslovak state.

	In The Lost Children: Reconstructing Europe’s Families after World War II (2011), Zahra illuminates an essential chapter of the postwar period in Europe—the negotiations over the repatriation of children and the reconstitution of families. Starting with the efforts of rescue groups during the Armenian genocide and the Spanish Civil War, to the Second World War and postwar conflicts over repatriation and appropriate psychological treatment of unaccompanied or orphaned children, she shows that questions about how best to serve children’s interests were in fact an integral part of debates concerning how to rebuild the nation, physically and psychologically, after the devastation of war. Currently engaged in a new project that examines a century of emigration from East Central Europe to Western Europe and the United States, Zahra is entering into important new debates about the notions of individual freedoms and human rights and offering a more transnational understanding of events in twentieth-century Europe.

	About Tarell's Work

	Tarell Alvin McCraney is a playwright exploring the rich diversity of the African American experience in works that imbue the lives of ordinary people with epic significance. Complementing his poetic, intimate language with a musical sensibility and rhythmic, often ritualistic movement, McCraney transforms intentionally minimalist stages into worlds marked by metaphor and imagery.

	His most well-known works, a triptych collectively titled The Brother/Sister Plays (2009), weave West African Yoruban cosmology into modern-day stories of familial self-sacrifice, unrequited love, and coming of age. The audience becomes an essential part of the story as the characters speak their stage directions and inner feelings directly to the viewers. In Head of Passes (2013) and Choir Boy (2012), McCraney draws on themes that run throughout the Book of Job and traditional spirituals, respectively, to explore the role of faith and tradition in two very different close-knit worlds. Head of Passes, set in the isolated marshlands of the Mississippi River Delta, dramatizes a matriarch’s struggle to maintain her faith as her world literally falls apart around her. In Choir Boy, students at an elite boarding school remain united in their dedication to performing traditional spirituals even as they navigate the fraught nature of adolescent self-expression.

	In addition to writing new works, McCraney is committed to bringing theatre to elementary and secondary school students, particularly in underserved communities in his hometown of Miami. His ninety-minute adaptation of Hamlet (2010), an intense, condensed version of the play set within a contemporized historical context, employs a visually explosive, expressive staging that engages audiences of all ages, whether or not they have a previous familiarity with Shakespeare. In telling stories that are simultaneously contemporary and universal, McCraney is demonstrating to new and younger audiences the ability of theatre to evoke a sense of our shared humanity and emerging as an important voice in American theatre.

	About Taylor's Work

	Taylor Mac is a writer, director, actor, singer, and performance artist whose fearlessly experimental works dramatize the power of theater as a space for building community. Mac (who uses judy [lowercase] as a gender pronoun) merges high and low theatrical conventions—from classical Japanese theater to popular music concerts—and interacts with the audience to inspire a reconsideration of assumptions about gender, identity, ethnicity, and performance itself.

	In The Lily's Revenge (2009), audience members are encouraged to interact with the actors during intermissions of this allegorical breaking down of binary conventions of sexuality. Judy stretches and reconfigures the social arrangements of the traditional living room drama in HIR (2014), as the locus of power shifts away from the patriarchal figure to a wife and gender-transitioning teenager. For the hugely ambitious A 24-Decade History of Popular Music (2014–2016), judy reimagines America's history through a queer lens and explores the homophobia, racism, and other forms of exclusion that have marked the American experience. Each decade of America's existence is presented through one hour of popular music and historical commentary performed by Mac; usually presented in three- to four-hour segments, Mac performed the entire 24 hours in fall 2016. Judy's joyful, charismatic, and vulnerable performance style disarms the audience, turning passive spectators into active participants. Over the course of the hour depicting1896–1906, sections of the audience move to the stage to represent the waves of immigrants coming to America. Judy's songs about life in the crowded tenements of 1920s New York come to life as the entire audience is crammed onto the stage for an hour. The enactment of a ""gay junior prom"" in the 1966–1976 decade—in which the audience is asked to dance with a partner of the same gender—crystallizes Mac's goal of transforming a roomful of strangers into something more intimate through shared experience.

	With these and other works, Mac is challenging audiences to reimagine our relationships to one another and demonstrating ways in which the arts can be a tool for inspiring social change.

	Biography

	Taylor Mac's additional works as a writer and performer include The Last Two People on Earth: An Apocalyptic Vaudeville (2015),The Walk Across America for Mother Earth (2011), The Be(A)st of Taylor Mac (2006), and The Young Ladies Of (2005). Currently a resident playwright of the HERE Arts Center, Mac's work has been performed at numerous national and international venues, including Lincoln Center, the Public Theatre, the Sydney Opera House, St. Ann's Warehouse, and the Curran Theatre in San Francisco.

	About Ted's Work

	Ted Ames, a long-term, Maine lobster and ground fisherman, has fused the roles of fisherman and applied scientist in response to increasing threats to the fishery ecosystem resulting from decades of over-harvesting. Ames grew up in a fishing family on one of Maine’s remote offshore islands and studied biochemistry at the University of Maine. Having spent several decades of his life at sea, he has witnessed dramatic shifts in the economic landscape throughout the Gulf of Maine, specifically in jobs and shoreside infrastructure. In an effort to address these changes and develop new fisheries management practices for the affected areas, Ames undertook detailed studies of spawning, habitat, and fishing patterns.  His studies, reinforced by a rigorous methodology, draw distinctively from the anecdotal experiences of aging fishermen to map historical patterns and chart the evolution of current conditions. His work paints a scientifically compelling picture of the complexity of the fish population structure in the Gulf and identifies new strategies for individual and institutional marine management in the region. Ames has now established the Penobscot East Resource Center to conduct additional studies of fishing patterns, past and present, and put to further use his trademark approach of combining fishery science and fishermen’s knowledge in the interest of protecting essential fish habitats.

	Biography

	Ted Ames received an M.S. (1971) in biochemistry from the University of Maine, Orono. He is an independent researcher, commercial fisherman, and a founding member of the Stonington Fisheries Alliance. He served as executive director of the Maine Gillnetters Association, as marine resources director for Maine’s sustainable fisheries organization, the Island Institute, as president and laboratory director of Alden/Ames Laboratory, and for many years as an advisor to the New England Fisheries Management Council. He is currently a practicing fisherman and serves as chair of the Penobscot East Resource Center, a community organization that provides support to local groups engaged in marine management and fisheries stewardship.

	About Terence's Work

	Terence Tao is a mathematician who has developed profound insights into a host of difficult areas, including partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, combinatorics, and number theory. He has made significant advances in problems such as Horn’s Conjecture, which he and Allen Knutson showed can be reduced to a geometric combinatorial configuration known as a “honeycomb”; this problem holds deep implications for more abstract mathematical relationships in algebraic combinatorics. His analysis of the Schroedinger equation, a central element of quantum mechanics, has provided new avenues for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Recently, with Ben Green, Tao offered a proof of the longstanding conjecture that there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions consisting only of prime numbers. (For millennia, mathematicians have studied the properties of prime numbers, which find important applications in cryptography among other things.) In addition to his research, Tao has taken a leadership role in educating mathematics students through his web site, commentaries, books, and lectures. His work is characterized by breadth and depth, technical brilliance and profound insight, placing him as one of the outstanding mathematicians of his time.

	About Teresita's Work

	Teresita Fernández is a sculptor who integrates architecture and the optical effects of color and light to produce exquisitely constructed, contemplative spaces. In her sculptural environments, Fernández alters space to create illusions, subtly modifying the physical sensations of the viewer and dramatizing the role architecture plays in shaping our lives and perceptions. Her room-sized installations evoke quietude and mystery, reflecting such diverse aesthetic influences as Roman and Ottoman architecture and Japanese gardens. In other works, she creates large-scale, referential constructions, such as a pool, a waterfall, and a sand dune stripped of specific context. With these pared-down pieces, she invites viewers to draw from their personal memories and observations. Employing common building materials to startling effect – tiny plastic cubes form a shimmering rainbow and acrylic rods suggest the flexible strength of bamboo – she inspires viewers to see a new relationship between built environments and the natural world. With lyrical and immaculately executed indoor and outdoor works, Fernández is pushing the boundaries of sculpture and installation art into the fields of architecture and landscape architecture.

	About Terrance's Work

	Terrance Hayes is a poet who reflects on race, gender, and family in works marked by formal dexterity and a reverence for history and the artistry of crafting verse. Employing an almost improvisational approach to writing, Hayes conjoins fluid, often humorous wordplay with references to popular culture both past and present in his subversion of canonical poetic forms.

	In a series of “blue” poems for his collection Wind in a Box (2006), he both references and eschews the standard tropes and forms of blues poetry by speaking in the persona of such figures as Jorge Luis Borges, David Bowie, and Strom Thurmond. “The Blue Seuss” is both a satiric embodiment of Seussian rhymes and styles and a condensed, heart-wrenching history of the African American experience, from the Middle Passage to contemporary urban decay. Hayes continues his exploration of the shifting nature of identity in Lighthead (2010), which includes a mixture of constructed and historical personages and ranges over a multitude of experiences. The imagery of “Carp Poem,” ostensibly an account of teaching a poetry workshop in a New Orleans prison, seamlessly moves back and forth from the reality of the prison to the confinement of slavery and Hayes’s personal relationship with his father, who is a prison guard.

	His formally daring poem “Arbor for Butch” plays off of pecha kucha, a Japanese business presentation format in which twenty images connected to a single theme are narrated for twenty seconds each. Using the sculptures of Martin Puryear as his images, Hayes links the visual with the sonic and the lyrical in an affecting consideration of what it means to be a father and a son. In creating works that seamlessly and meaningfully encompass both the historical and the personal, Hayes is extending the possibilities of language and pushing the art of poetry toward places altogether new.

	About Terry's Work

	Terry Belanger is a historian, collector, and protector of one of humankind’s greatest inventions: the book. To support the study of the book’s long history, Belanger created a teaching and archive facility, the Rare Book School (RBS), in 1983 as part of Columbia University’s School of Library Service; in 1992, he moved it to its current home at the University of Virginia. The RBS functions as an independent, non-profit institute devoted to the histories of manuscripts, print, electronic text, and everything in between. It transcends the limitations of traditional degree programs by making its wide-ranging offerings available to a broad range of professionals interested in studying and preserving these cultural artifacts; historians, literary scholars, librarians, conservators, collectors, and book artists attend RBS courses each year. In the classroom, Belanger uses original tools and materials to provide students with hands-on experience and to emphasize the relationship between the physical and intellectual structure of the book. He assiduously collects items related to bookmaking, from the remains of incunabula (the first printed books of the fifteenth century) and their handwritten precursors to books demonstrating the range of bindings and structures, to samples of materials from which books have been constructed. With thousands of former students currently at work in the field and offshoots of his programs in California, France, Australia, and New Zealand, Belanger is making the world a more secure place for the irreplaceable legacy of the book.

	About Terry's Work

	Terry Plank is a geochemist working literally at the edge of phenomena shaping the Earth’s crust. Her research focuses on what happens when tectonic plates collide, forcing one under the other at a subduction zone. Because these collisions generate tremendous heat, they are frequently associated with volcanoes, which Plank uses as a window to the chemical and physical forces deep below the surface. In early work, she analyzed trace metals in deep core samples from rock entering a subduction zone and compared them with magma ejected from associated volcanoes, finding that the magma unexpectedly includes materials from the subducted crust, rather than exclusively new rock formed from the Earth’s mantle. More recently, she has demonstrated that the chemical composition of volcanic rocks reveals the temperature at the point of rock formation, where the subduction plate intersects the mantle. These data are essential for accurate modeling of tectonic geophysics. Furthermore, her observations of certain volcanic minerals that trap water demonstrate the critical role they play in the geochemistry of rock formation at subduction zones (it is water and other volatiles that account for the volcanic explosions). Though the motion of tectonic plates triggers some of the Earth’s greatest spectacles—earthquakes, pyroclastic lava flows, geysers, etc.—the science of plate tectonics is still in its early stages. With painstaking fieldwork, careful analysis, and profound insight, Plank is uncovering details about the complex interplay of thermal and chemical forces that drives this usually imperceptible but remarkably powerful natural force.

	About Theodore's Work

	Theodore Zoli is a structural engineer who is leading the design of elegant and enduring bridges around the world and making major technological advances to protect transportation infrastructure in the event of natural and man-made disasters. An expert in long-span, cable-supported bridges, he has played a key role in the creation of a number of bold contemporary structures, from the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge in Boston to the Blennerhassett Island Bridge over the Ohio River. Zoli’s recent work on the monumentally scaled Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge demonstrates his ability to respond to the contexts and challenges specific to each project. By dramatically reducing the weight and cost of the original design — involving a highly complex, horizontally curved surface — and devising solutions to address both wind- and pedestrian-induced vibrations, he ensured the success of the bridge’s striking “S” shape. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Zoli has focused, as well, on developing armoring strategies to retrofit iconic bridges across the United States to maintain their structural integrity against the possibility of damage from explosion. Drawing from military research on terrorist weapon technologies and tank armor, he developed a novel composite material that represents the state of the art in lightweight, blast-resistant coverings for a broad array of construction applications. In an era of aging infrastructure and catastrophic structural collapses, Zoli is safeguarding vulnerable links in the nation’s highway system and developing design principles for the construction of robust, new landmarks in the United States and across the globe.

	About Thomas' Work

	Thomas Whiteside was an investigative reporter who specialized in the subject of mass communications.

	In 1969, Whiteside began to investigate the subject of the dioxin contaminant in the chemical mixture Agent Orange, then being used in herbicidal warfare in Vietnam.  His writings were largely responsible for Senate subcommittee hearings in 1970 on the safety of the herbicide 2,4,5-T.  After these hearings, official restrictions were imposed on the domestic use of Agent Orange and an effective ban was placed on its use in the Vietnam War.  Whiteside also had written at length on the subject of U.S. policies concerning chemical and biological warfare.

	Biography

	In mass communications, Whiteside had written on various aspects of broadcasting, and on the threat to the free flow of ideas posed by economic and structural developments in the publishing business.  His book, The Blockbuster Complex (1981), led the Federal Trade Commission to examine these developments and to investigate anti-competitive practices in book distribution.  His other works include Defoliation (1970), The Pendulum and the Toxic Cloud (1977) and Computer Capers (1978).  He had been a contributor to the New Yorker magazine since 1950.

	About Timothy's Work

	Timothy Barrett is an internationally recognized master craftsman and paper historian who is preserving and enhancing the art of hand-papermaking through his work as a practitioner, scholar, and teacher. Combining the skills of artist, ethnographer, scientist, and historian, he documents and demonstrates centuries-old hand-papermaking practices that may otherwise be lost. As the founding director of the papermaking facilities at the University of Iowa Center for the Book — the only academic program in the United States that focuses on producing traditional Western- and Japanese-style papers and teaching-related techniques — he has trained a generation of papermakers to create conservation-sound paper. His Japanese Papermaking: Traditions, Tools, and Techniques (1983) draws on research he conducted in Japan on the history of paper as well as his experience as a papermaking practitioner; this groundbreaking volume compiles (for Western audiences) essential knowledge about the unique qualities of handmade Japanese paper, which is a fundamental repair material for all conservators. Synthesizing his deep understanding of various papermaking traditions of the east and west and innovative, modern techniques, Barrett has developed a variety of specialty and production papers to address the needs of book and paper conservators. Among his many conservation projects, he and his co-workers fabricated the handmade archival paper used to re-house the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution as part of the “Charters of Freedom Re-encasement Project” in 2002. Deeply committed to the preservation and future of his art form, Barrett continues to enrich the fields of hand-papermaking, paper conservation, and the history of paper.

Titus Kaphar,2018-06-15,42,Male,Painter,NXTHVN,"New Haven, Connecticut","2-D Visual Art, 3-D Visual Art","
                  
	About Titus's Work 

	Titus Kaphar is an artist whose paintings, sculptures, and installations explore the intersection of art, history, and civic agency. He works across genres, often appropriating and manipulating Western art’s styles and mediums to address pressing social concerns, such as the legacy of slavery in the United States and the confluence of racial injustice, punishment, and protest.

	He employs traditional painting techniques only to rupture the coherence of the scenes and figures he represents—and their attendant claims to authority—through a literal deconstruction or obscuring of the image and its physical support. For example, in Sacrifice (2011), which comprises two distinct elements, Kaphar initially rendered a formal group portrait of three men, two black and one white, on a traditional canvas. He then cut the seated white figure away and resituated it atop the bare stretcher bars that would have supported an accompanying canvas. As a result, the work depicts a double loss: the black men flank a glaring absence, and the white man is bereft of any context whatsoever. Kaphar’s practice also includes drawing, performance, and immersive environments. The Vesper Project (initiated in 2013) recounts the story of a fictional, nineteenth-century New England family of mixed heritage whose members pass as white, though legally they are considered black. For the project, he painstakingly installed within a gallery a reconstruction of the Vesper family’s two-room residence in an advanced state of dilapidation. The decaying and disordered house serves as the setting for a number of other deconstructed paintings by the artist that address questions of historical representation, memory, and the erasure of identity. More recently, in a body of work collectively called Monumental Inversions (begun 2016), he has turned his attention to traditions of monument making and public commemoration in the United States.

	Kaphar’s commitment to social engagement has led him to move beyond traditional modes of artistic expression to establish NXTHVN, an art space based in New Haven, Connecticut, which will open in Winter 2019. It provides studio spaces and residencies for artists and curators to develop and realize new creative initiatives in keeping with the organization’s mission to cultivate an artistic community in a city plagued by deep and long-standing socioeconomic divides. A logical extension of Kaphar’s artistic practice, NXTHVN turns the difficult lessons and insights gleaned from historical reflection into tangible, forward-looking action. Through a growing body of work that yokes grim yet naturalized historical realities to contemporary crises of social justice, Kaphar is marshalling the combined powers of art and history to effect social change.

	Biography

	Titus Kaphar received a B.F.A. (2001) from San Jose State University and an M.F.A. (2006) from Yale University. He is the founder and president of NXTHVN. His work has been exhibited at MoMA PS1, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Chrysler Museum of Art (Norfolk, Virginia), the Seattle Art Museum, the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, and Princeton University, among other venues; and he is represented in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, the Pérez Art Museum Miami, and the Equal Justice Initiative Museum in Montgomery, Alabama, among other public collections.

	About Tiya's Work

	Tiya Miles is a public historian who explores the complex interrelationships between African and Cherokee people living and working in colonial America. Her studies tease evidence from census records, legal petitions, missionary reports, newsprint, and oral histories and span territories east and west in the South, before and after the Trail of Tears (1838-1839) and up to the Civil War. In her first book, Ties That Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom (2005), Miles details the life of Cherokee farmer and celebrated warrior Shoe Boots, his marriage to and later abandonment by a white Southern girl he once held captive, and his subsequent union with their black servant, Doll. In prose that is reflective, precise, and insightful, Miles challenges folklore and mythology surrounding early Afro-Indian communities while also illustrating a broader tangle of intricate personal intimacies, sovereign allegiances, and ancestral tensions. Continuing her inquiry into early Afro-Indian relations, Miles has completed a public history project and a book centered on the Diamond Hill plantation in Georgia, one of the largest Native-owned plantations in colonial history. In The House on Diamond Hill: A Cherokee Plantation Story (2010), she documents Chief James Vann's control of his plantation and abuse of his Cherokee wives and African slaves, presenting a family history and an economic hierarchy that tragically mirrors the social order of early Southern society. Her nuanced portrayals of African and Native people in slavery and displacement in colonial America, and their ensuing legacy, are contributing importantly to the current discourse on ancestry and citizenship in contemporary America. A scholar of range and promise, and increasingly an authoritative voice in reframing and reinterpreting the history of our diverse nation, Miles is adding texture and depth to the mosaic that was our shared past and that is our heritage.

	About Toba's Work 

	Toba Khedoori is a young artist whose large-scale drawings and paintings on paper appear to float in empty space. Unlike many contemporary artists who employ newer methods such as installations and video projections, Khedoori uses traditional materials—wax, oil paint, and pencil—to create immense but delicate drawings on vast stretches of unframed paper. Her imagery represents urban or architectural elements—such as rows of windows in a façade, a corridor lined with closed doors, or bricks in a dislocated wall—that define our living space. While the work is realistic in its detailed representation of images, it is abstract in the isolation in which the artist places these images. Her quiet, reticent works operate on both a cerebral and an emotional level. They can be likened to visual poems, conveying a sense of mystery and inviting the viewer to speculate on their meaning while appreciating their serene beauty.

	About Todd's Work

	Todd Martinez is a theoretical chemist who seeks to explain and predict complex chemical reactions based on the quantum mechanical properties of the atoms involved in the reaction. His work focuses on describing molecules at excited states, where conventional ground state electronic structure calculations are inadequate to capture the nature of their chemical reactivity. At subatomic scales, the electrons and nuclei do not behave like billiard balls, but rather are intrinsically statistical; when graphed, the probabilities representing possible states of a molecule can appear as familiar shapes. In a class of chemical reactions referred to as ""nonadiabatic"", graphs of potential energy surfaces form cones and these cones intersect. Martinez develops strategies and algorithms that predict the dynamic evolution of systems having conical intersections. He has created models for photoisomerization in several biochemically important molecules. Photoisomerization is a nonadiabatic process in which a photon triggers a molecule to change its conformation (but not its constituent atoms); among other things, it represents the biophysical basis for vision. By combining effective strategies for computing the quantum mechanical properties of complex molecules with a deep intuition for their underlying chemical behavior, Martinez is revealing fundamental insights into the physical basis for chemical reactions.

	About Tom's Work

	Tom Joyce is a master artist-blacksmith who handles hot metal with lyrical skill. With a thorough, self-taught grasp of the ancient tradition of blacksmithing, Joyce celebrates the history of his craft, but is not bound by it. Ranging in scale from small, geometrically exquisite bowls to sprawling outdoor installations, his broad body of work includes both functional objects—architectural ironwork, vessels, lighting centerpieces—and abstract sculptures. Joyce creates works that touch viewers on multiple levels: their fusion of form and function, their relationship to a community of users, and their materials’ history of use. His designs tap the spontaneity of forged metals, elegantly combining aesthetics and utility. His public works, such as a multi-paneled gate forged of scrap metal salvaged from the banks of the Rio Grande by local residents, are suffused with reference to community and environment. While shaping discarded metals into exciting new forms, Joyce preserves indications of their earlier use, highlighting their transformation through time. His recent projects incorporate non-ferrous objects, such as books charred by forging iron around them, exploring notions of the transitory and the permanent. Through such consistently experimental work, Joyce extends a millennia-old craft into an art form for the twenty-first century.

In his program at Logan High School in Union City, California, Lindsey instills in his students the importance and power of persuasion, based on clear communication, reasoning, and mastery of the facts. American high school forensics is dominated by a small number of schools located primarily in the most affluent areas of the country; by contrast, many of Lindsey's students come from poor families, broken homes, or difficult urban environments. He has repeatedly demonstrated that students can surmount these circumstances by force of character, personal experience, hard work, and commitment to excellence. His students regularly excel in the preparation and delivery of their orations, competing effectively and winning national forensics championships. By showing his students that they can compete intellectually at the highest levels and teaching them skills they can use throughout their lives, Lindsey recasts the imaginative possibilities for hundreds of young women and men; more than ninety percent of his students go on to attend college. Through his tireless efforts to support, inspire, and lead his students, Lindsey serves as a role model not only for them, but for all who seek to shape the future of young people.

	About Trevor's Work

	Trevor Paglen is a conceptual artist and geographer making the invisible operations of military and corporate power visible to everyday citizens. He draws on his training as a geographer and utilizes the tools of image-making, coupled with painstaking review of public records and declassified documents, to explore infrastructures of warfare, surveillance, and social control that are generally hidden from the general public. The resulting images, sculptural works, and writings he produces examine the ways that human rights are threatened in an era of mass surveillance and data collection.

	Paglen developed a method of ""limit telephotography,"" which uses high-power telescopes in combination with cameras, to photograph secret prisons and military bases. In an ongoing body of photographs known collectively as ""The Other Night Sky,"" Paglen works with amateur astronomers to document classified satellites that orbit the earth. The mysterious images of the physical manifestations of military power hover between abstraction and information, between the inscrutable and the mundane. They are at once compelling as visual compositions and chilling as photographic documentation of activities that are otherwise based on speculation. More recently, Paglen has explored the ocean floor to make photographs of underwater fiber optic cables that circle the Earth and enable internet connection and developed tools to show what artificial intelligence networks and other autonomous surveillance systems ""see"" when they look at the world.

	In addition to exhibiting his photographic work in traditional gallery settings, Paglen also elaborates on its societal implications in his written work, which includes book-length essays. Blank Spots on the Map: The Dark Geography of the Pentagon's Secret World (2009) focuses on classified detention facilities, military outposts, satellites, and CIA front companies; The Last Pictures (2012) ponders the long-term footprint of humankind on planet Earth; and ""Invisible Images: Your Pictures Are Looking at You"" (2016) is an essay about the implications and dangers of autonomous vision systems. Paglen is creating a diverse body of work to equip viewers with the knowledge to hold power accountable and ensure the ideals of democracy are upheld.

	Since 1979, Brown has collaborated on numerous large-scaled productions with Robert Rauschenberg, Donald Judd, Laurie Anderson, and other artists and musicians.  Her best-known ballets include Line Up (1977), Set and Reset (1983), M.O. (1995), and El Trilogy (2000).  She also has designed, directed, and choreographed the opera productions, Monteverdi’s l’Orfeo (1998) and Sciarrino’s Lui Mie Traditrici (2002).  Brown’s works have been performed throughout the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, China, Australia, and the former Soviet Union.  An accomplished visual artist, her drawings have been shown at major international exhibitions including the Venice Biennale.

	Brown received a B.A. (1958) from Mills College.

Tyshawn Sorey,2017-06-15,37,Male,Composer and Musician,"Department of Music, Wesleyan University","Middletown, Connecticut",Music Performance and Composition,"
                  
	About Tyshawn's Work

	Tyshawn Sorey is a multi-instrumentalist, improviser, composer, ensemble leader, and conductor assimilating and transforming ideas from a broad spectrum of traditional and experimental idioms into musical creations that celebrate alternative musical modeling within the improvisation-composition continuum.

	A virtuosic percussionist and drum set player who is fluent in piano and trombone, Sorey is an ever-curious explorer of the nature of sound and rhythm, ensemble behavior, and the physicality of live performance. He erodes distinctions among musical genres as well as the line between composition and improvisation and incorporates sophisticated rhythmic and harmonic phrasing, highly prescribed improvisational sound worlds, and real-time experimentation with sound, among many other structural elements. At the same time, he possesses a refined sense of restraint and balance that allows him to maintain his own unique voice while bringing a vast array of musical settings to life. He explores various World and Eastern musical and philosophical concepts on his albums Koan (2009) and Alloy (2014), employing musical languages that range from slowly developing tonally and pantonally based music to free atonal pieces that contain irregular rhythms, lyrical phrasing, and distinctive pacing. Inner Spectrum of Variables (2015) features an extended composition in six movements that merges the harmonic and melodic vocabularies of Western classical, American, and Ethiopian creative expressions, free improvisation, and twentieth-century avant-garde musical traditions. In his song cycle Perle Noire: Meditations for Josephine (2016), Sorey reimagines the legendary Josephine Baker's works; his original recreations of songs sung by Baker reflect both the context of her contributions to the civil rights movement and contemporary incidences of racial injustice. Sorey challenges expectations of jazz piano trio performance on Verisimilitude (2017), a set of five abstract, enigmatic, and austere pieces in which the delineation between spontaneous and formal composition is even more obscured.

	In addition to his own work as a composer, conductor, and ensemble leader, Sorey's prowess as a percussionist and drum set player is well known, and he continues to be in high demand as a sideman for popular creative artists. With his genre-free approach to making music and continuous experimentation, Sorey is rapidly emerging as a singular talent in contemporary musical composition and performance.

	Biography

	Tyshawn Sorey received a B.Music (2004) from William Paterson University, an M.A. (2011) from Wesleyan University, and a D.M.A. (2017) from Columbia University. His additional albums as a leader include Oblique-I (2011) and That/Not (2007), and he has appeared on numerous other recordings as a sideman or co-leader. Sorey has presented work and given lectures at such national and international venues as Lincoln Center, the Village Vanguard, Walt Disney Hall, the Danish Rhythmic Conservatory, the Newport Jazz Festival, Ojai Music Festival, the Banff Center, Cité de la Musique, Hochshule für Musik in Cologne and Nuremberg, and at Wesleyan University, where he recently was appointed an assistant professor of music specializing in creative improvised and experimental music traditions.

	About Ubaldo's Work

	Ubaldo Vitali is a fourth-generation silversmith, conservator, and scholar who draws upon a deep knowledge of past and modern metalworking techniques to restore historical masterworks in silver and to create original works of art. Trained in the workshops of his father and grandfather, Vitali works entirely by hand, from the mixing of raw materials and chemical analyses to building custom-made tools, wooden models, and wax molds. As a conservator of works from medieval Europe to colonial America, he restores the aesthetic integrity of pieces distorted by damage or age. Based on his examination of written archival sources and material objects, he also preserves the physical and metallurgical evidence related to a piece's fabrication, thereby illuminating the original artisan's process and the social and intellectual underpinnings of his design. Vitali provides further insight into the design principles and execution processes of specific historic periods by creating replicas of antique objects. For example, his replication of a bronze lion aquamanile, using only those raw materials and methods available to the medieval metalworker, has shed light on the dissemination and evolution of speculative alchemy from the writings of Islamic philosophers to medieval European workshops. In his original designs of commissioned presentation pieces, tureens, centerpieces, and such whimsical works as a domino set and a soda bottle made entirely of silver, Vitali explores the physical limits of his chosen material and how the interplay of light and reflections on the polished silver creates multiple layers of texture and detail. Through the beauty of his craftsmanship and rigorous approach to restoration, Vitali is playing a vital role in preserving historical collections and reinvigorating classic silversmithing with a twenty-first-century idiom.

	About Uta's Work

	Uta Barth is an artist whose evocative, abstract photographs explore the nature of vision and the difference between how a human sees reality and how a camera records it. In contrast to documentary and confessional modes of photography, Barth intentionally depicts mundane or incidental objects in nondescript surroundings in order to focus attention on the fundamental act of looking and the process of perception. In white blind (bright red) (2002), she investigates both literal and metaphorical modes of perception in ghostly compositions that mimic the afterimages that persist in one’s visual memory after turning away from an object. Her recent series, …and to draw a bright, white line with light (2011), marks the first time Barth has intervened in the staging of her photographs. By manipulating curtains in her home, she created lines and curves of light that expand from a sliver to a wide ribbon across a sequence of large-scale, dramatically cropped images that evoke the subtle passage of time while also highlighting the visceral and intellectual pleasures of seeing. As Barth continues to expand her photographic practice to probe the theme of perception in new and inventive ways, she is encouraging viewers to reconsider the traditional functions and expectations of the photographic image.

	About Valeria's Work

	Valeria Luiselli is a writer of fiction, essays, and inventive hybrids of the two who challenges conventional notions of authorship and explores the experience of dislocation as a common theme across her many projects. Writing with dry humor and deftly controlled prose in both Spanish and English, she often wrestles with the complexity of translation and draws from an unusually broad range of Latin American, American, and European literary traditions.

	Luiselli’s novel La historia de mis dientes (2014), translated into English as The Story of My Teeth (2015), chronicles the adventures of an auctioneer and teller of tall tales named Gustavo “Highway” Sánchez Sánchez while experimenting with alternative modes of literary production. The project originated as a commission from the art gallery of the Mexican juice corporation Grupo Jumex. Luiselli engaged the workers in the Jumex factory as collaborators in the writing process, sharing installments of the work in progress with them and incorporating their reactions into the novel’s chapters. Her most recent books synthesize the formal inventiveness of her earlier work with her experiences as a court interpreter for unaccompanied child migrants caught in the labyrinth of U.S. immigration policy. In the nonfiction work Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions (2017), she demonstrates the impossibility of giving coherent, narrative form to the harrowing and fragmented statements that the immigration intake questionnaire elicits from children facing deportation. These stories, her attempts to document them, and the ethical dilemmas these efforts pose also figure prominently in her novel Lost Children Archive (2019). The novel is a fictionalized account of her own family’s road trip from New York to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, with stories of the unfolding Central American migration crisis nested into the narrative through radio news reports, phone calls to a friend whose daughters are missing, and a novel-within-the-novel that the mother reads aloud about children making their way to an unnamed land. Rather than dividing the work into chapters, Luiselli organizes it around archival “boxes” of materials—audio recordings, texts, maps, and photographs—that her protagonists collect and reference throughout their journey.

	As she forges new forms of writing that interweave multiple voices—those of other writers, readers, translators, and the children she interviews—Luiselli is posing profound questions about the various ways we piece together stories and pass them on to subsequent generations.

	Vamsi Mootha is a clinician-researcher who converts the promise of new technologies such as genomics and proteomics into tangible, important insights regarding basic biological processes and the sources of human diseases. He specializes in the subcellular structures responsible for energy metabolism: the mitochondria. Recently, Mootha and colleagues have isolated peptide fragments from these organelles and identified them with mass spectroscopy. By comparing the protein fingerprints with gene expression databases, more than 100 previously unknown mitochondrial proteins were identified. He used a similar, coordinated approach to identify the gene that causes Leigh Syndrome French Canadian variant, a fatal metabolic disease. In diseases resulting not from a single gene but the interaction of sets of genes, he introduced a computational method for identifying patterns of gene activity in specific diseases. In type 2 diabetes, for example, this method has identified aberrations in the regulation of genes related to a specific metabolic pathway, an observation that may provide important clues to the cause of a prevalent and devastating condition. As importantly, Mootha has pioneered powerful, adaptable computational strategies for mining data collected in laboratories throughout the world, providing an efficient means to hunt down gene interactions that lead to a wide variety of diseases.

	About Vanessa's Work

	Vanessa Ruta is a neuroscientist tackling one of the fundamental questions of neuroscience: how the brain processes sensory information and generates behavioral responses. Animal behavior consists of the interplay of innate (or instinctual) and learned behaviors that arise from sensory experience. Ruta draws on a breadth of scientific training, spanning molecular biophysics to systems neuroscience, and uses the model system of Drosophila (fruit fly) to glean cross-disciplinary insights that advance the science of innate and learned behaviors.

	Her facility with and imaginative deployment of sophisticated techniques such as optical labeling, intracellular electrophysiology, and chemical imaging have allowed her to visualize and probe neural circuits, including the function of individual synapses within the brain of an awake, behaving fly responding to stimulus from the physical world. By mapping a pheromone sensing circuit, one synaptic link at a time, from the sensory input to behavioral output during Drosophila courtship, Ruta has discovered key divergence points in sensory processing pathways in male and female brains, indicating a mechanism by which the same pheromone input is processed in a gender-specific manner to elicit the unique behaviors of male and female flies. She then traced how the male fly reacts to receiving both positive and negative mating sensory cues simultaneously. Ruta and her lab expanded on this work in investigations of how the fly’s internal state, learning, and experience interact with sensory information in the Drosophila mushroom body, a key region of the brain for associative learning.

	Recently, using cryo-electron microscopy, Ruta and colleagues elucidated the protein structure of an insect odorant receptor and presented the first structural understanding of how the chemical world is detected. In another line of work, they developed genetic reagents to directly compare the same pheromone processing neural pathways in recently diverged Drosophila species, providing explicit insight into how evolution shapes neural circuits to generate species-specific mate preferences. Through her multidisciplinary approach and unique understanding of the correlation among anatomy, synaptic activity, and behavior, Ruta is shedding light on how sensory stimuli can elicit profoundly different behavioral responses as a result of neural circuits being modified through evolution or individual experience.

	Quote from Vanessa

	How do we learn, recognize objects, or navigate social interactions? While these computations form the basic fabric of our human experience, how they arise from the bewilderingly complex circuits of our brain remains a mystery. My work is inspired by the potential of simpler systems, like tiny insects, to provide insight into the core mechanisms of brain circuits and ultimately unravel the brain’s fundamental logic.

Applying years of experience as both an FDA official and a pharmaceutical executive, she created a model for drug development that is driven by the needs of the developing world. iOWH’s expertise extends from identifying drug and vaccine leads, to conducting extensive clinical trials, to securing regulatory approval for new medicines. Focusing on potential cures for parasite-borne diseases, Hale and her colleagues acquire donated rights to promising compounds that have either been deemed unprofitable by the pharmaceutical industry or left undeveloped by research labs unable to obtain funding. Since its inception in 2000, Hale’s institute has collaborated with universities, hospitals, drug manufacturers, and international regulatory agencies and marshaled significant financial resources from foundations, corporations, and individuals to launch five drug and vaccine development programs that span four neglected disease areas and three continents. iOWH recently received approval for and brought to market its first drug, paromomycin, a low-cost antibiotic cure for visceral leishmaniasis, which afflicts approximately 1.5 million people worldwide, primarily in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sudan. Treatments underway for malaria, diarrheal disease, and Chagas disease hold the potential to save the lives of millions more. By negotiating regulatory processes that have long stymied drug delivery to those most in need, Hale is scaling what many have viewed as an indomitable wall and working to relieve human suffering on a massive, global scale.

	About Victoria's Work

	Victoria Orphan is a geobiologist whose research sheds new light on microbial communities in extreme environments and their impact on the cycling of nutrients and energy through the oceans. Much of her work focuses on microorganisms living in deep-sea beds that sequester large quantities of methane released from seeps in the ocean floor. Because these microbes cannot easily be cultured (or grown) in the laboratory, Orphan skillfully combines techniques from molecular biology and mass spectrometry into novel methods that enable the capture and analysis of the activities of individual microbial cells, as well as the relationships among different microbes, in their natural environments.

	She and colleagues have shown that some deep-sea microbes consume methane as their primary source of carbon. This process, known as anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), removes significant quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas stronger than carbon dioxide, that would otherwise reach the planet’s atmosphere. Orphan’s contributions to identifying and understanding symbiotic interactions between groups of methane-oxidizing Archaea (single-celled organisms) and bacteria in the deep sea hold important implications for understanding Earth’s ocean and climate dynamics. Her subsequent research has illuminated the physical, chemical, and biological interactions behind deep-sea methane oxidation, including the roles iron and manganese play in AOM and the capability of these methane-consuming archaea to fix (or convert) dinitrogen gas into usable forms essential to all life.

	Orphan is also exploring the details of the symbiotic relationship between methane-consuming archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria that drives this oxidation process. She recently provided evidence for extracellular electron transfer as the coupling mechanism between these organisms and has developed ways for manipulating their activity and interactions in the lab. Through her work on fundamental questions in microbial ecology, Orphan is unraveling the biogeochemical processes underlying methane, sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycling and increasing our understanding of key determinants of Earth’s climate.

In fiction and nonfiction works that serve as complements to one another, Nguyen reveals how depictions of the Vietnam War, and of the refugees it displaced, often fail to capture the full humanity and inhumanity, the sacrifices and savagery, of participants on opposing sides of the conflict.

	His novel, The Sympathizer (2015), calls attention to the blind spots in American perspectives on the war by assuming the point of view of an unusually multifaceted character: a communist double agent who works for a South Vietnamese general while spying for the North Vietnamese, both during the war and after taking refuge in the United States. The unnamed spy narrates his experience as both betrayer and betrayed in an engrossing and darkly comic confession that gives the novel its structure. One of the novel's most satirical sections exemplifies Nguyen's approach to fiction as a potent form of cultural criticism, as he places his narrator in the role of an authenticity consultant for a Hollywood movie reminiscent of Apocalypse Now, with Vietnamese from a refugee camp recruited to play the parts of nonspeaking villagers. He delves further into the subject of one-sided accounts of conflict in his 2016 nonfiction book, Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War. Nguyen weaves together personal narratives, philosophical meditations, and analyses of literature, cinema, photography, cemeteries, and monuments—not only from the United States and Vietnam, but from Cambodia, Laos, and South Korea, as well. The juxtaposition of this range of sources throws into relief how America's war stories have been perpetuated as global historical memories that obscure the experiences of populations that suffered far greater devastation and casualties, both combatant and civilian.

	With his recently published collection of short stories, The Refugees (2017), he continues his exploration of the tensions, traumas and conflicting loyalties that endure far beyond a war's end. Nguyen's body of work not only offers insight into the experiences of refugees past and present, but also poses profound questions about how we might more accurately and conscientiously portray victims and adversaries of other wars.

	About Vija's Work 

	Vija Celmins is a painter and a sculptor of realistic and abstract creations.

	Celmins' earliest works are matter-of-fact still lifes of ordinary household items that demonstrate an acute perception of physical detail, and the meticulous transmutation of this physicality from three dimensions to two.  In her early work, she used graphite on paper to render drawings of the surface of the moon and other vast subjects: the ocean, the night sky, and the desert.  Her canvases of the night sky and the ocean demonstrate subtle abstract variations.  Regardless of medium or subject, her intensity of observation and her rigorous transformation of physical reality into art (oscillating between concrete and abstract presentations) yield a powerful body of work.

	Biography

	Celmins lives and works in New York and California.  She has taught at numerous institutions, including the California Institute of the Arts (1966-77), the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (1981), The Cooper Union (1984), and the Yale Graduate School (1987).  Retrospectives of her work have traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Walker Art Center, the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.

	Celmins received a B.F.A (1962) from the John Herron Institute in Indianapolis, and an M.F.A. (1965) from the University of California, Los Angeles.

	About Vijay's Work 

	Vijay Gupta is a violinist and social justice advocate providing musical enrichment and valuable human connection to the homeless, incarcerated, and other under-resourced communities in Los Angeles. After joining the Los Angeles Philharmonic as a young violinist, Gupta began to give lessons to Nathaniel Ayers, a Juilliard-trained musician whose mental illness led to homelessness. This experience motivated him to play for the homeless and mentally ill living on Skid Row, an area of concentrated poverty and homelessness in downtown Los Angeles and, eventually, to cofound the not-for-profit Street Symphony.

	Street Symphony harnesses the power of the arts to foster social connection and support. Along with nearly eighty musicians he has recruited from the L.A. Philharmonic and elsewhere, Gupta and Street Symphony present regular monthly programs of live musical performances at shelters, county jails, and treatment and transitional housing facilities. Street Symphony also offers musical education through workshops and its recently launched Fellows Program, which pairs emerging artists from local universities with talented individuals from Skid Row for a year-long instruction program.

	One of Street Symphony’s most notable efforts is its annual performance of Handel’s Messiah on Skid Row. In free community workshops, residents are invited to perform or create their own pieces, culminating in a final performance of new original works alongside selections from Handel’s oratorio. Gupta’s model of outreach to marginalized individuals in places that offer other social services and his strategy of generating musical projects through extended engagement and by forging interpersonal relationships has begun to inspire other performing groups in the Los Angeles area to be more socially conscious. Dedicated to bringing beauty, respite, and purpose to those all too often ignored by society, Gupta is demonstrating the capacity of music to validate our shared humanity and focusing needed attention on interrelated social issues that cluster at places such as Skid Row.

	About Vijay's Work

	Vijay Iyer is a pianist, composer, bandleader, electronic musician, and writer forging a new conception of jazz and American creative music through an eclectic oeuvre that includes compositions for his own and other ensembles, collaborations across multiple genres and disciplines, and scholarly research on the act of listening.  An ardent investigator of musical communities, practices, histories, and theories, he mines core rhythmic, melodic, and structural elements from a wide range of sources to construct richly varied, improvisation-driven solo and ensemble music.

	Iyer’s compositions for jazz quartet on his album Reimagining (2005) feature elaborate melodic constructions and intricate rhythmic techniques influenced by South Indian classical music, West African drumming, contemporary European composers, and twentieth-century African American piano masters. On Historicity (2009) and Accelerando (2012), he imaginatively rearranges works by Stevie Wonder, Leonard Bernstein, Duke Ellington, Michael Jackson, M.I.A., and others, developing new rhythms, textures, and strategies for the piano trio.

	Parallel to these projects, he has expanded his creative practice through frequent collaborations with poets. Holding It Down: The Veterans’ Dream Project (2013) illuminates the lived experience of war and the subsequent return to civilian life, as the dreams of minority veterans from the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are rendered as lyrics and set to a restless, poignant electroacoustic score punctuated by moments of improvisation.

	With academic training in music cognition, Iyer complements his musicianship with writings for both specialist and general audiences that investigate the ever-shifting relationship between culture, perception, and aesthetics. Through his wide-ranging body of work, Iyer is creating a unique voice in diverse musical contexts while reaffirming the place of music not just as entertainment but as an essential part of human society.

	About Vincent's Work

	Vincent Fecteau is a sculptor whose deceptively intricate, abstract pieces provoke thoughtful reflection as their challenging forms make the viewer aware of the act of perception. Though modest in scale and constructed from humble, unassuming materials, such as papier-mâché and cardboard, Fecteau’s sculptures reward close and extended looking. He takes a slow and contemplative approach to his craft, giving careful consideration to how sculptural elements—mass and volume, solid and void, color and texture—fuse to establish surprising configurations that compel the viewer to deepen and prolong one’s engagement with the object.

	In three series of untitled works from 2008, 2010, and 2012 made primarily from papier-mâché and painted in odd yet alluring combinations of color, irregular exteriors conceal and reveal corresponding interior spaces. The pieces cohere into balanced forms even as they seem to hover on the verge of instability. Their undulations emphasize the handmade (as opposed to machine-produced) nature of the works, and the sculptures’ various twists and swerves, which move between elegance and ungainliness, convey a subtle visual humor as they flirt with notions of decoration. In a recent body of work from 2015, Fecteau incorporates collaged paper elements into quasi-architectural scenarios that are charged with spatial ambiguity and a theatrical sense of drama. Fecteau’s concern with perceptual experience extends to the display of his work as well. The untitled pieces from 2010, for instance, are intended to be mounted on the wall rather than on pedestals and can be rotated and reversed to offer multiple presentations of their surfaces and spaces.

	The results are both captivating and demanding; as viewers work to understand what they are seeing, they find themselves at the threshold between visual perception and objective knowledge of three-dimensional space. In this way, Fecteau imbues his work with philosophical content, just as the work assumes psychological dimensions through its uncanny correspondences with the human body. In our age of ever-increasing distraction, Fecteau’s sculpture offers a place for the sustained experience of thought and observation to unfold and flourish.

	Vincent Fecteau received a B.A. (1992) from Wesleyan University. His work has appeared in numerous national and international exhibitions at venues including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Carnegie Museum of Art, Kunsthalle Basel, and the Secession, Vienna.

	About Wafaa's Work

	Wafaa El-Sadr is an infectious disease specialist who has developed a multi-pronged approach to treating some of the most pressing pandemics of our time — HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) — diseases that disproportionately afflict people with the least access to quality health care. El-Sadr regularly applies her clinical and public health expertise to quantitative studies of pharmacologic treatment protocols to identify, for example, alternative medications for patients who are unable to tolerate a preferred therapy. She also has led investigations of preventive measures, such as early trials of anti-microbial gels that may inhibit HIV transmission, as well as behavioral factors related to treatment, such as when and how impoverished patients seek help. Rather than focusing on proximal pathological processes, El-Sadr develops treatment strategies by considering such factors as access to health care, education, social status, and economic stressors. With patient compliance in long-term TB treatment being especially problematic, she has demonstrated multiple benefits of recruiting homeless TB patients to serve as monitors of directly observed antibiotic treatment of other patients. El-Sadr is also recognized internationally for her leadership in preventing maternal-child HIV transmission. Though perinatal retroviral inhibitors reduce infant risk of contracting AIDS, she has shown that aggressive drug therapy throughout pregnancy and beyond is vital to preserving the integrity of the family, thereby maximizing the long-term health prospects of the child. Through her work developing effective treatment programs in impoverished and immigrant communities in Harlem, as well as in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, El-Sadr sets ever-improved standards for health care delivery for patients facing devastating disease under severe economic hardship.

	About Walter's Work

	Walter Hood is a landscape and public artist creating urban spaces that resonate with and enrich the lives of current residents while also honoring communal histories. Hood melds architectural and fine arts expertise with a commitment to designing ecologically sustainable public spaces that empower marginalized communities. Over his career, he has transformed traffic islands, vacant lots, and freeway underpasses into spaces that challenge the legacy of neglect of urban neighborhoods.

	Through engagement with community members, he teases out the natural and social histories as well as current residents’ shared patterns and practices of use and aspirations for a place. He designed Lafayette Square Park (1999) in Oakland to serve its diverse users: children play on a grassy artificial hill that references the former domed observatory on the spot, and walkways, game tables, and a performance space serve nearby residents and the homeless who have frequented the park since the Great Depression. With Splash Pad Park (2003), also in Oakland, Hood created an oasis among busy roadways that provides pedestrian access between neighborhoods; it is now home to the city’s largest farmer’s market. Hood’s designs for institutional settings, such as the gardens of the M. H. de Young Museum in Golden State Park (2005) and the walkways of the Broad Museum in Los Angeles (2015), demonstrate his ability to interweave erudite, elegantly crafted spatial and material configurations into the context of local geography and ecology.

	More recently, Hood has undertaken ambitious commemorative landscapes that reflect his interest in the role of sculpture in public space. His plans for Nauck Town Square in Arlington County, Virginia (2016–present), located in a neighborhood whose residents are descendants of a pre-Emancipation community of freed blacks, include a towering sculpture that spells “Freed” made from replica slave badges. For the landscape surrounding the forthcoming International African American Museum (2020), to be built on the site where nearly 40 percent of enslaved Africans arrived in this country, Hood has designed a memorial garden filled with native grasses and featuring a tidal pool whose waters will recede at regular intervals to reveal an engraved pattern of life-sized figures, aligned as though confined within the hold of a slave ship. Hood is broadening the myriad ways in which a place can be transformed by intervention in the landscape and imbuing social justice and equity into public spaces that make past and present community lifeways visible.

	About Walter's Work

	Walter Kitundu is a young sound artist and inventor of original musical instruments that navigate the boundary between live and recorded performance. Inspired by hip-hop, other modern musical forms, and traditional Asian and African instruments, Kitundu’s phonoharps are hybrids of turntables and stringed instruments. At once highly sculptural art objects and functional instruments, the phonoharps offer a wide range of melodic possibilities and are surprisingly versatile in performance. The turntable’s pickup collects and amplifies any sound transmitted to it, allowing the performer to employ percussion and string resonance as well as digital manipulation, or sampling, of prerecorded material. Kitundu takes full advantage of the phonoharp’s flexibility in electro-acoustic compositions that seamlessly incorporate experimental, jazz, and pop music influences. Many of Kitundu’s artistic pursuits, including ambitious proposals for public installations of his instruments, reflect his ongoing interest in the interaction between technology and the natural world. His elemental phonoharps, for example, draw on natural forces such as wind, waves, light, and the movement of birds to produce unique sound sculptures. An experimental instrument builder, composer, and musician, Kitundu’s interdisciplinary approach to music-making and performance is inspiring a wide range of musicians and audiences.

	About Wes' Work

	Wes Jackson is the founder and co-director of the Land Institute, a nonprofit organization in Salina, Kansas.

	Under Jackson’s direction, the Land Institute is known for its pioneering work in Natural Systems Agriculture, an ecologically sound and perennial food-grain-producing system.  Reaching beyond the species studied by most agronomists, Jackson has focused on long-term, genetic selection to locate forgotten sources of disease resistance, perennialism, and drought tolerance.  Using techniques such as materials recycling and solar energy, he combines these traits of natural ecosystems with the food-yielding properties of more conventional species to produce vigorous hybrids.  His method of agriculture mitigates soil erosion, lessens agrochemical contamination of land and water, and cuts demand for fossil fuels, making conservation a nearly effortless consequence of crop production.

	Biography

	Jackson’s work at the Institute includes informing educational institutions and the public about the benefits and feasibility of Natural Systems Agriculture.  His articles have been published in such journals as Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment and Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences.

	Jackson received a B.A. (1958) from Kansas Wesleyan University, an M.A. (1960) from the University of Kansas, and a Ph.D. (1967) from North Carolina State University.

	About Whitfield's Work

	Whitfield Lovell is an artist whose poetic and intricately crafted tableaux and installations document and pay tribute to the passage of time and to the daily lives of anonymous African-Americans. Inspired by images from his archive of photographs, tintypes, and old postcards from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of the civil rights movement, Lovell provides these obscure figures with identity and dignity. He creates meticulously rendered, life-sized, charcoal portraits on such wooden objects as sections of walls, fences, or barrels, evoking a haunting sense of their presence. He places these portraits in the context of found, everyday objects — including frying pans, spinning wheels, bed frames, clocks, irons, and musical instruments — to reveal the individual through items related to his or her life. These compelling and seemingly simple installations are informed by contemporary art practice as well as folk art, vernacular art, and the physical conditions of marginalized communities. Creating remarkably elegant works, Lovell evokes memories of the past while transcending the specifics of time and space.

	Whitfield Lovell received a B.F.A. (1981) from the Cooper Union School of Art. He taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York from 1987 to 2001 and has been a visiting artist at such institutions as Rice University (1995), the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (2001), and the Contemporary Art Center of Virginia (2002).

	About Will's Work

	Will Allen is an urban farmer who is transforming the cultivation, production, and delivery of healthy foods to underserved, urban populations. In 1995, while assisting neighborhood children with a gardening project, Allen began developing the farming methods and educational programs that are now the hallmark of the non-profit organization Growing Power, which he directs and co-founded. Guiding all is his efforts is the recognition that the unhealthy diets of low-income, urban populations, and such related health problems as obesity and diabetes, largely are attributable to limited access to safe and affordable fresh fruits and vegetables. Rather than embracing the “back to the land” approach promoted by many within the sustainable agriculture movement, Allen’s holistic farming model incorporates both cultivating foodstuffs and designing food distribution networks in an urban setting. Through a novel synthesis of a variety of low-cost farming technologies – including use of raised beds, aquaculture, vermiculture, and heating greenhouses through composting – Growing Power produces vast amounts of food year-round at its main farming site, two acres of land located within Milwaukee’s city limits. Recently, cultivation of produce and livestock has begun at other urban and rural sites in and around Milwaukee and Chicago. Over the last decade, Allen has expanded Growing Power’s initiatives through partnerships with local organizations and activities such as the Farm-City Market Basket Program, which provides a weekly basket of fresh produce grown by members of the Rainbow Farmer’s Cooperative to low-income urban residents at a reduced cost. The internships and workshops hosted by Growing Power engage teenagers and young adults, often minorities and immigrants, in producing healthy foods for their communities and provide intensive, hands-on training to those interested in establishing similar farming initiatives in other urban settings. Through these and other programs still in development, Allen is experimenting with new and creative ways to improve the diet and health of the urban poor.

	About William's Work

	William Dichtel is a chemist whose innovations in synthetic and supramolecular chemistry hold promise for bringing a new class of nanostructured materials out of the lab and into daily use. Dichtel has pioneered the development of porous polymers known as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are formed from molecules with specific shapes that simultaneously polymerize (combine to form larger molecules that contain repeating structural units) and assemble into ordered two-dimensional grids or three-dimensional scaffolds. The tiny pores of COFs confer extremely high surface area—approaching that of a football field per gram of the polymer—making them of interest for molecular separations, sensing trace substances, storing chemical fuels or electrical charge, and purifying water, among other potential applications.

	The first COFs contained simple building blocks lacking interesting functions as well as linkages that degrade rapidly in water, and they were formed as insoluble powders not easily processed into devices. If unaddressed, these attributes would relegate COFs to academic curiosities. Dichtel and his group overcame these challenges by introducing functional monomers, such as those capable of absorbing visible light or accepting and releasing electrons reversibly, into COF structures, thus demonstrating their potential in, for example, organic photovoltaic devices and batteries. To address the difficulties in processing COFs into devices, Dichtel formed thin layers of COFs directly onto surfaces by using a sheet of graphene to direct their polymerization, thereby providing a general means to connect these materials to electrodes.

	Despite their promise, much remains unknown about the molecular-level details of how COFs polymerize and crystallize. Dichtel and his group have developed new methods to study the mechanism of COF formation and have already challenged long-standing but untested assumptions about expanding the concept of polymerization in two and three dimensions. Dichtel’s breadth of expertise, ranging from small molecule organic chemistry to materials and device fabrication, and his pioneering demonstration of COFs with unprecedented functionality and improved stability have made him a leading figure in chemistry.

	About William's Work 

	William J. Barber II is a pastor and social justice advocate building a broad-based grassroots movement grounded in the moral tenets of faith-based communities and the United States Constitution to confront racial and economic inequalities in America today. As pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina (since 1993), and president of the North Carolina conference of the NAACP (2005–2017), Barber approaches social justice through the lens of the ethical and moral treatment of people as laid out in the Christian Bible, the Reconstruction and civil rights movements of the South, and the U.S., Constitution.

	He is effective at building unusually inclusive fusion coalitions that are multiracial and interfaith, reach across gender, age, and class lines, and are dedicated to addressing poverty, inequality, and systemic racism. When his work to expand voting rights, health care, living wages, immigrant rights, public education and LGBTQ rights was thwarted by state lawmakers in North Carolina, Barber began a series of “Moral Monday” rallies outside of the statehouse in Raleigh to protest laws that suppressed voter turnout, cut funding for public education and health care, and further disenfranchised poor white, black, First Nations, and LGBTQ communities. The Moral Monday marches and associated nonviolent acts of civil disobedience grew to involve tens of thousands of participants across North Carolina and spread to other states. The movement waged successful legal challenges to voter suppression and racial gerrymandering and engaged in massive voter registration and education efforts.

	Barber founded Repairers of the Breach, a national leadership development organization, in 2014 to expand upon the Moral Monday movement, and in 2017, he and colleagues launched a revival of the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign that was originally spearheaded by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and many others. To recast the movement for the twenty-first century, the Campaign conducted an audit of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, and the war economy in the United States since 1968. The findings of the audit have been used to inform and build state and local, nonpartisan fusion movements committed to challenging laws and policies that are antithetical to these four broad tenets of social justice. Merging moral and activist traditions, Barber is providing a faith-based framework for action that strengthens civic engagement and inspires the country to imagine a more humane society.

In The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy (1987), Wilson advanced the thesis that the precipitous decline of manufacturing jobs, coupled with the out-migration of the middle class, have resulted in the concentration of poverty in America’s inner-city neighborhoods.  He explores the devastating consequences of massive job loss in such isolated communities in his book, When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor (1996).  Wilson is also the author of Power, Racism, and Privilege: Race Relations in Theoretical and Sociohistorical Perspectives (1973), The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions (1978), and The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics (1999), among other works.

	Biography

	Wilson is the Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

	Wilson received a B.A. (1958) from Wilberforce University, an M.A. (1961) from Bowling Green State University, and a Ph.D. (1966) from Washington State University.

	About William's Work

	William Seeley is a clinician-researcher who integrates microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical examination to explore the structural, functional, and behavioral aspects of human neurodegenerative disease. Seeley concentrates on frontotemporal dementia, a family of devastating neurological syndromes usually afflicting people in midlife, and second only to Alzheimer's as the primary cause of progressive pre-senile dementia. Though frontotemporal dementia results from degeneration only in specific cortical regions (that is, not globally or randomly), the mechanisms that trigger the onset and progression remain largely unknown. Seeley and colleagues observed that a morphologically distinctive cell type, known as von Economo neurons, shows a marked decrease in number with frontotemporal dementia, but not Alzheimer's disease. Using functional MRI, Seeley demonstrated changes in brain activity of afflicted individuals in regions that correlate with loss of von Economo neurons. Further differentiating patients based on behavioral manifestations, he has mapped specific changes in cortical connectivity networks that correspond with each clinical subtype of frontotemporal dementia. Considered collectively, these results connect damage at the cellular level with altered regional brain activity, and those observations with their symptomatic manifestations. Such imaging studies find immediate application in tracking disease progression and customizing therapeutic interventions for individual patients. Seeley's observations represent a key step toward identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the initiation and spread of frontotemporal dementia and lay the groundwork for developing targeted treatments to halt its progression.

	About Wu's Work 

	Wu Tsang is a filmmaker and performance artist who combines documentary and narrative techniques with fantastical detours into the imaginary in works that explore hidden histories, marginalized narratives, and the act of performing itself. Tsang re-imagines racialized, gendered representations beyond the visible frame to encompass the multiple and shifting perspectives through which we experience the social realm.

	Tsang’s work as an artist emerges from collaboration, particularly as a co-organizer of a weekly nightclub called Wildness, which was a flashpoint for underground art and community activism in Los Angeles. Taking place at an immigrant gay bar near MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, Wildness created a space where the bar’s longtime patrons, queer people of color, mixed with artists and performers. Tsang’s feature film Wildness (2012) documents this scene and the perpetual negotiation of race, gender, and socioeconomic class among the patrons, who wrestle with questions of gentrification, authenticity, and ownership as they encounter each other’s realities. The bar itself plays a leading role in the film, serving as an omniscient narrator and embodying the imaginative and performative acts through which cultural fictions are formed and expressed.

	In a recent film Duilian (2016), Tsang similarly blurs fantasy and reality to explore the gap between the well-known public persona of Qui Jin, an early twentieth-century revolutionary Chinese poet, and the obscurity of her personal life and sexuality. The film imagines Qui Jin’s relationship with her female friend and calligrapher, Wu Zhiying, as an intimate love affair. They converse using Qui Jin’s poems, many of which were translated into English for the first time for this project, but their moments of idyll and fantasy are intercut with jarring yet beautiful scenes of wushu martial arts. Tsang’s ongoing and deeply considered portrayals give visual and narrative form to struggles over who speaks for whom, whose voices get heard, and whose get silenced.

	Wu Tsang received a B.F.A. (2004) from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an M.F.A. (2010) from the University of California at Los Angeles.

	Xiaowei Zhuang is a young biophysicist who uses optical spectroscopic methods to reveal the behavior of individual molecules. Originally trained in polymer physics, Zhuang made several widely cited contributions to understanding the basic principles of liquid crystal behavior, findings that have direct application to the design of computer displays. She changed her research focus after graduate school to the study of protein folding and enzyme catalysis. Scientists typically study these processes by measuring bulk samples; Zhuang has demonstrated the use of fluorescent labeling techniques to monitor them within single molecules. Her studies verify that a given molecule can take more than one path during folding or catalysis—sometimes measurements from bulk samples mask the less commonly used alternative paths. She also observed that, in reversible processes, individual molecules seem to “remember” their preferred path. Recently, Zhuang has applied single molecule methodology to explore the mechanism of viral membrane fusion with host cells. Understanding this process and its variations at the individual molecule level will provide critical insights into the basic biology of infection and may help to identify possible targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis.

	About Yitang's Work

	Yitang Zhang is a mathematician who emerged from relative obscurity with a landmark achievement in analytic number theory: the so-called bounded prime gap, which essentially establishes that the difference in spacing between two consecutive prime numbers is, infinitely often, bounded by a fixed number.

	Prime numbers have inspired great intrigue over the last centuries, and one of the most basic unanswered questions has been the spacing between two consecutive prime numbers, or the twin prime conjecture, which states that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by two. Despite many efforts at proving this conjecture, mathematicians were not able to rule out the possibility that the gaps between primes continue to expand, eventually exceeding any particular bound. Zhang’s work shows that there are infinitely many consecutive primes, or pairs of primes, closer than 70 million. In other words, as you go to larger and larger numbers, the primes will not become further and further apart—you will keep finding prime pairs that differ by less than 70 million.

	While these conjectures have no known direct applications, although some allude to possible impact in cryptography, they represent a quintessentially hard problem, an area that has frustrated generations of mathematicians. Zhang built on techniques developed by experts over the last fifty years but combined these in a masterful way to provide the best possible qualitative approximation of the twin prime conjecture. His work has generated significant collaborations across the community to expand on his effort, and within months of his discovery that number was reduced from 70 million to less than 5,000. Zhang’s impact will surely grow as he turns his focus and incredible perseverance to other truly hard questions in number theory.

	Yiyun Li is a fiction writer whose spare and quietly understated style of storytelling draws readers into powerful and emotionally compelling explorations of her characters’ struggles, set both in China and the United States. After moving from China to the United States in 1996 to pursue a graduate degree in immunology at the University of Iowa, Li shifted her studies to the Iowa Writers’ Workshop and focused on fiction writing in her adopted language of English. Her prose in this second language bears the inflections of her mother tongue and culture, lending a vivid and arresting quality to the voices and experiences she presents to English-speaking readers. In her story collection A Thousand Years of Good Prayers (2005), Li inhabits the lives of ordinary individuals, rendering their separate predicaments with empathy and a keen eye for illuminating details that give each character depth and nuance. Through these intimate and elegantly constructed portraits of people largely ignored by history—Chinese nationals as well as expatriates in the United States—Li magnifies and dramatizes the myriad effects of late-twentieth-century China’s political upheaval and sweeping social changes. She expands upon related themes on the larger canvas of her novel The Vagrants (2009), which depicts life in a provincial Chinese town during the turbulent years following Mao’s death in the late 1970s. The novel opens on the day a young woman is to be executed as a counter-revolutionary and proceeds to trace the intersecting fates of a wide-ranging cast of townspeople. In these and other works, Li crafts deeply moving fiction that offers Western readers a window into unfamiliar worlds as well as insights into human nature that transcend ethnicity and place.

	Yoky Matsuoka, a leader in the emerging field of neurorobotics, is transforming our understanding of how the central nervous system coordinates musculoskeletal action and of how robotic technology can enhance the mobility of people with manipulation disabilities. Working at the intersection of computer science, biophysics, material science, biomechanics, and psychophysics, Matsuoka creates sophisticated prosthetic devices and designs complementary rehabilitation strategies. In one line of research, she constructed an anatomically correct robotic hand, complete with an intricate tendon structure that enables it to respond to sensor signals closely resembling neural commands. This model has facilitated investigations into the neuromuscular forces necessary for precise finger movement and constitutes an important step toward the development of a dexterous prosthetic hand that can be controlled by the brain’s neural signals. Another major project involves the use of virtual environments and visual feedback to distort recovering stroke patients’ perceptions of tasks they perform during therapy. Designed to address the condition of “learned nonuse,” a habit of decreased movement that affects a quarter of all stroke patients, this system encourages subjects to push beyond perceived limitations to their range of motion and strength, thereby providing more accurate assessments of their progress and increasing the efficacy of rehabilitation. By illuminating the biomechanics of the hand and experimenting with robot-human interfaces that alter the neural control of movement, Matsuoka is making technological advances that hold life-changing potential for those suffering from serious brain injuries and reduced functional capabilities.

	About Yukiko's Work

	Yukiko Yamashita is a developmental biologist exploring the biochemical, structural, and molecular genetic mechanisms that regulate stem cell division. For most organ systems, complex organisms use small pools of stem cells to replace specialized cells that are injured, infected, or wear out. Yamashita studies the division of stem cells to establish which ones go on to replace differentiated cells and which ones maintain the pool of stem cells for future division. For stem cells in the reproductive tract of fruit flies, the path the dividing cells take is not random, but regulated; newly copied chromosomes eventually differentiate into sperm cells, while the original chromosomes remain within the stem cell pool. Yamashita's research has uncovered several important elements that choreograph this asymmetric division. She and her colleagues have identified specific proteins expressed by support cells that surround each stem cell, providing a spatial frame of reference for the stem cell. Within the dividing cell, chromosome-separating assemblies need to be oriented precisely relative to the support cells for the division to complete — stem cell division stalls if the chromosomes are improperly aligned. Yamashita has extended this result, observing that misalignment occurs more frequently with age, with errors beginning considerably earlier than other, more conventional markers of organism aging would suggest. In addition to insights about the impact of age on stem cell function, Yamashita's basic investigations illuminate the mechanisms underlying the loss of control over stem cell division, which is regarded as the primary cause of many human diseases such as some cancers or other proliferative disorders.

	Yuval Sharon is a director and producer of opera expanding the possibilities of where, when, and how opera can be performed. As founder and artistic director of The Industry, a Los Angeles–based production company, Sharon brings together singers, instrumentalists, and emerging technologies in nontraditional performance spaces, transforming opera from an experience of passive listening to one that is immersive, multisensory, and mobile.

	Sharon's production of Christopher Cerrone's Invisible Cities (2013) was performed in Los Angeles's Union Station. The station remained operational throughout the performance, with musicians, dancers, and audience members interspersed among travelers and commuters. Based on the 1972 novel by Italo Calvino in which Marco Polo recounts his adventures, the opera explores themes of imagination and is experienced through headphones, so that each listener's experience is as individualized as one's own imagination. In the fall of 2015, Sharon premiered Hopscotch: A Mobile Opera for 24 Cars, which takes place in various locations around Los Angeles, ranging from the opulent interiors of the Bradbury Building to the Los Angeles River to the roof of the Toy Factory Lofts. The audience is transported from location to location in limousines, and at each stop, as well as in the vehicles themselves, singers and musicians enact a story of love, loss, and a mysterious disappearance. The non-sequential plot allows audience members to travel along one of three different routes, a logistical feat characteristic of Sharon's ambitious vision. Along the way, the fabric of the city and goings-on of its inhabitants are integrated into the mobile opera, disrupting the distinction between fiction and reality.

	Sharon's dedication to realizing both contemporary and canonical operatic works beyond the constraints of traditional presentations is infusing this dramatic musical genre with a new vitality and attracting a new generation of enthusiasts and patrons.

	Her avant-garde films, as well as her theoretical work, involve issues of feminism, theories of representation and spectatorship, psychoanalysis, and the critical study of culture.  In 1972, Rainer completed her first feature-length film, Lives of Performers.  Her many films include Film About A Woman Who… (1974), Kristina Talking Pictures (1976),Journeys from Berlin/1971 (1980), The Man Who Envied Women (1985), Privilege (1990), MURDER and murder (1996), and After Many a Summer Dies the Swan: Hybrid (2002).

	Biography

	Rainer continues to work as an independent choreographer and filmmaker.  She also conducts seminars for the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art.  Her work has been the subject of more than a dozen retrospectives hosted by such institutions as the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York and the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco.  Encompassing material composed between 1966 and 1997, a collection of Rainer’s writings entitled A Woman Who…: Essays, Interviews, Scripts was published in 1999.  Her work is also the subject of the exhibition catalog Yvonne Rainer: Radical Juxtapositions 1961-2002 (2002).

	Rainer attended San Francisco City College (1951) and was one of the founders of the Judson Dance Theater in 1962.

	About Zachary's Work

	Zachary Lippman is a plant biologist investigating the genetic networks underpinning plant development and growth and creating new breeds of hardier, higher yielding crops. A key element in a plant’s fruit-bearing capacity and robustness is an appropriate balance between two competing functions: the production of shoots and leaves (needed for nutrition) and the production of inflorescences (flowering branches), which make fruits and seeds. Using the tomato as a model system, Lippman combines traditional plant breeding methods with genomic tools to optimize the agricultural balance of plant inflorescence and leaf production.

	He has demonstrated the ability to create allelic variants (or mutations) that can sidestep the painstaking process of breeding for qualities that take many generations to produce while maintaining beneficial elements of the original plant. Lippman identified several genes that regulate and respond to the tomato’s hormone system governing leaf and flower production, and, through targeted editing of these genes using CRISPR, he was able to customize and optimize the balance of the two for different agricultural needs. He has also made genetic changes to inflorescence branch architecture in order to support increased flower production, resulting in plants that have increased yields. Lippman has since used these methods to create and characterize large numbers of de novo (or original) genetic variations in tomatoes. By making targeted changes in a few critical genes, his group has taken major steps toward domesticating the groundcherry, a previously wild species, while retaining the resilience of this berry-producing plant to grow in suboptimal conditions. 

	Increasing the genetic diversity of our crops and domesticated plants will be critical to safeguarding food security in the face of growing challenges from climate change, population growth and movement, and water shortages. Lippman’s research, which is generalizable to many other crops, indicates the possibility of identifying genomic targets, accelerating quantitative genetic variation of those targets, and breeding for beneficial traits such as drought, heat, pathogen resistance, and increased yield much faster than occurs in nature.

	Biography

	Zachary Lippman received a BS (2000) from Cornell University and a PhD (2004) from the Watson School of Biological Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). Lippman held a Human Frontiers postdoctoral research fellowship at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel for three years prior to starting his own research program at CSHL in 2008, where he is currently the Jacob Goldfield Professor of Genetics. In 2018, he was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. Lippman’s articles have appeared in journals including Cell, Nature Genetics, Nature Plants, and Genome Research.

	About Eiko and Koma’s Work

	Eiko (female) and Koma (male) are dancers and choreographers who have created an unusual theater of movement that engenders beautiful and mysterious images.

	Biography

	Their collaboration began as an experiment in 1972 in their native Japan and then developed into an exclusive partnership.  They had worked during the early 1970s with Japanese experimentalists, Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno, whom they continue to revere as teachers, and then in Germany with Manja Chmiel, a disciple of Neue Tanz exponent Mary Wigman.  Their artistry marries a non-Western sense of time and space with expressionist theatricality.  Often moving very slowly, but with considerable intensity, in visual environments of their own design, they create abstract shapes that blur the boundaries of animal, vegetable, and mineral, and suggest that the landscape is as alive as its inhabitants.  Among the more than two-dozen performance works they have created in America are White Dance (1976), Grain (1983), Thirst (1985), Tree (1988), Land (1991), Wind (1993), and River (outdoor environmental version, 1995), When Nights Are Dark (2000), Be With (2001), Offering (2002), and Tree Song (2004).

	Eiko and Koma’s performance pieces have been performed at festivals, universities, and museums throughout the world.

	Eiko and Koma are the first collaborative pair to receive a MacArthur Fellowship.
